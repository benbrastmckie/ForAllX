notes on PS11 Zach problems (11-17-22)

adding my problem values on shortened problem set:

(4+6)+(4+6)+6+6+6+6

4+6+4+6+6+6+6+6+14*4 

1) easy;short; but good test of checking the UD!

2) good one! although i forgot to say they are asteroids!

3) hard one; so defs leave on auto-checker if I include it!!! (Ex)(Ay)(Px & ((Py & ~x=y)> Lxy))
but I tried stuff like this a bunch: 
(Ex)(Ay)(Px & Py & ~x=y & Lxy)), which is wrong. but perhaps hard to motivate why this is wrong. presumably need a countermodel that makes one true but the other false! so try to think of that

4) good one and not too hard! got on first try modulo putting an atomic in parentheses lol: (Ax)( (Mx & Oxj & ~x=i) > Tx )

5) tough one! 
(Ax)((Tm & Te) & (Tx > (x=m v x=e) ))
at first i just wrote the following: 
(Ax)(Tx > (x=m v x=e)), and then it is hard to correctly build in the additional content that m and e both have an atmosopher. 

This also works:
(Ax)( (Tx > (x=m v x=e)) &(Te &Tm))

6) Even harder!!! did not get right on first attempt despite focusing pretty hard...
~~~{.Translate .FOL system="LogicBookPDE" points=1}
PS9.6 (Ex)(Mx /\ Oxm) /\ (Ax)(Ey)((My /\ Oyx) -> x=m),  (Ax)(Ey)((My /\ Oyx) <-> x=m) : Only Mars has a moon.
~~~

initial fail: (Ax)(Ey)( (My & Oym) & ( (My & Oyx) > x=m) )
failed: (Ax)(Ey)(Az)( (My & Oym) & ( (My & Oyx) > (x=m & z=y) ) )

i gave up and looked at answer, so probs don't include this one in the PSet; too hard! at least if you haven't read the chapter or notes!

one of zach's answers:
(Ax)(Ey)((My /\ Oyx) <-> x=m)
I feel like i perhaps just ought to pencil in my answer as acceptable! namely this one:
(Ax)(Ey)( (My & Oym) & ( (My & Oyx) > x=m)


7) man, also struggled with this one; but should include on the PSet i think
first two attempts:
(Ax)(Ay)( (Mx & Oxe & My & Oye) > x=y)
(Ex)(Ay)( (Mx & Oxe & My & Oye) > x=y)

but got it on third attempt, and i think would be easy if one had the pattern in mind:
(Ex)(Ay)( (Mx & Oxe) & ( (My & Oye) > x=y))
and this also works:
(Ex)( (Mx & Oxe) & (Ay)( (My & Oye) > x=y))

8) no idea why the following isn't right:
(Ax)( (Px & ~x=j) > Ljx)
seems that Zach wants you to tack on that jupiter is a planet, which I guess it's true you need to say lol:
(Ax)( (Px & ~x=j) > Ljx) & Pj


9) very easy! so defs include. minimal test of understanding

10) not sure why the following doesn't work:
~(Ex)(Ey)(Ez)(Mx & Oxy & Oxz & ~y=z & ~x=y & ~x=z)
oh i see; need to say that y and z are planets! 

but this also doesn't work!
~(Ex)(Ey)(Ez)(Mx & Oxy & Oxz &Py &Pz & ~y=z & ~x=y & ~x=z)

seems that Zach left out possibility of someone wanting to specify the x is distinct from the y and z. do we need to do this? presumably yes since by saying something is a moon, we don't logically rule out it being a planet as well!
i'll think i'll add this as a second allowed solN

11) this is a good one; include!
 I think i naturally wrote down the schema for "Mars has exactly two moons":
(Ex)(Ey)(Mx & My & Oxm & Oym & (Az)( (Mz & Ozm)> (z = x v z=y)))

But the following also didn't work...
(Ax)(Ay)(Az) ( (Mx & My & Oxm & Oym & Mz & Ozm) > (z = x v z=y ) )

missed case where x = y
(Ax)(Ay)(Az)( (Mx & My & Oxm & Oym & Mz & Ozm) > (z = x v z=y v x = y) )
but perhaps unclear to me why this isn't ALREADY covered, since if x and y are distinct, then the claim about z equalling either prevents three moons. but maybe we need x = y to handle case where there's only one moon! 

%since of course x could be z or x could be y. so if 

12) good, relatively complex but unambiguous one to include
got this one right on first try, so that's cool! but probs b/c i already thought about an earlier problem in terms of saying `exactly':
(Ex)(Ey)(Mx & My & Tx & Ty & ~x=y & (Az) ((Mz & Tz) > (z=x v z=y)))


13) got this right on first try, which is pretty cool; although almost screwed up parenthesis after the (Ay)

 (Ex)(Mx & Oxe & (Ay)(((My & Oye)>x=y)&(Az)( (Mz & Ozm) > Lxz)))

this also works:
 (Ex)(Ay)(Mx & Oxe & ((My & Oye)>x=y)&(Az)( (Mz & Ozm) > Lxz))

14) This one is tough! maybe too hard for an easy problem set. move to practice

my first try (wrong):
(Ex)(Px &~Tx & (Ay) ( (Py > Lyx) & ~y=x & (Az)( (Pz & Lyz) > x=z)))

another wrong attempt (but i'm adding this to allowed answers):
(Ex)(Px &~Tx & (Ay) ( ((Py & ~y=x) > Lyx)  & (Az)( (Pz & Lyz) > x=z)))

gave up and looking at answer:
(Ex)(Px /\ (Ay)((Py /\ ~x=y) -> Lyx) /\ ~Tx)
but this seems simpler than mine. seems to miss part of the definite description part, namely that any other planet that is the smallest is the same as x! 

zero clue to me why zach has following as an alternate answer:
(Ex)(Px /\ (Ay)((Py /\ ~x=y) -> Lxy) /\ Tx), since this seems to say that the largest planet has an atmosophere. so deleting this answer. 






15) tough one; got on second try! could include but maybe leave on the checker
first attempt: (Ex)(Ey)(Mx & My & Oxm & Oym & ~y=x & ~Lxe & ~Lye)

second attempt (restricting to exactly two moons!): (Ex)(Ey)(Mx & My & Oxm & Oym & ~y=x & ~Lxe & ~Lye & (Az)( (Mz & Ozm)>(z=x v z=y)))
