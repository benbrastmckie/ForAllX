%partial list of some solutions, as I make sure I can do some of these for class tomorrow; 10/18/22


PP6.20 is chill! very simple ~Intro example:

    A :AS for >I
        ~A :AS for ~I
        A :1 R
    ~~A :2-3 ~I
A>~~A :1-4 >I   

PP6.21 (typeset in the slides as well):
trick is to realize that you need to build up a conditional, and that the consequent you're working towards is ALSO a conditional, so then assume it's antecedent ~B.
Then, notice that to get its consequent (~A), you can do ~I on A
so working three levels of subproof deep for much of the proof! 



    (A ⊃ B) :AS for >I
        ~B :AS for >I
            A :AS for ~I
            B :1, 3 >E
            ~B :2 R
        ~A :3-5 ~I
    ~B>~A :2-6 >I
((A ⊃ B) ⊃ (~B ⊃ ~A)) :1-7 >I


PP6.22 (basically identical to prior problem, only now we do ~E on ~A. But same proof idea!)

    (~A ⊃ ~B) :AS for >I
        B :AS for >I
            ~A :AS for ~E
            ~B :1, 3 >E
            B :2 R
        A :3-5 ~E
    B > A :2-6 >I
((~A ⊃ ~B) ⊃ (B ⊃ A)) :1-7 >I

PP6.23 one direction of de Morgan's (actually not as hard as I thought initially; note that you could also do ~E on what you want to prove, but would be unnecessary/overkill. would still build up ~A&~B directly w/in that subproof:

~(A ∨ B) :PR
    A :AS for ~I
    A v B :2 vI
    ~(A ∨ B) :1 R
~A :2-4 ~I
    B :AS for ~I
    A v B :6 vI
    ~(A ∨ B) :1 R
~B :6-8 ~I
(~A & ~B) :5, 9 &I




PP 6.24 is genuinely tricky, since we don't have the falsum symbol! so we need to make the SAME contradiction on both our disjunction elim proof by cases. and this is a bit tedious! took me 17 lines. even though it's pretty obvious we'll have a contradiction on either branch of our disjunction (either A&~A or B&~B, but we basically need to pick one so that we can do vE. then use that contradiction to finish the ~Intro on A v B. (so end up going four layers of subproof deep at one point....)


    (~A & ~B) :AS for >I
        A v B :AS for ~I
            A :AS for vE
            ~A :1 &E
            A&~A :3, 4 &I
        --
            B :AS for vE
            ~B :1 &E
                ~(A&~A) :AS for ~E
                B :7 R
                ~B :8 R
            A&~A :9-11 ~E
        A&~A :2, 3-5, 7-12 vE
        A :13 &E
        ~A :13 &E
    ~(A v B) :2-15 ~I
((~A & ~B) ⊃ ~(A ∨ B)) :1-16 >I
