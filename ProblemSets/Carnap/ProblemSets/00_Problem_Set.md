<!---
This is practice problem set, to work out some bugs. Hoping it will also serve as a template for future problem sets. 

Comments to self can be entered with [blah blah]:: or [](blah blah). Former needs an empty space before the line! 
-->

[results so far]::

<!---
Note that all three of the short answer questions below turned green upon submission, despite the exam option I set for the last one. 

Note that if you assign zero points to the assignment as a whole, it does not auto-grade anything it seems...e.g. did not autograde my second question, even though I have the give-credit="onSubmisson" points=2 options. 

Just changed point value of assignment to 7, and will see if this changes auto-grading. can then see if i can later make assignment worth 0 points and see what happens in the gradebook!

# Problem Set \#0: Getting familiar with *Carnap*

<br />

[somehow assigned point value of 5 for the following problem, so maybe that's a default if you don't specify number of points?]::

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer}
0.0 If you worked with up to two other students on these problems, please let me know their names in the text box below:
```


Below are the truth-functional connectives that you will come to know and love. Feel free to familiarize yourself with how to type them into *Carnap* on your keyboard. You will always be able to copy-paste the symbol as well if you prefer (but that method could be tedious!).

The symbolization problems are case-sensitive! So you must enter CAPITAL letters for the atomic sentences or else *Carnap* will not accept them. You can enter the lowercase letter `v` for the or symbol, and it should work, but it must be a LOWERCASE `v`. Unless the problem says otherwise, stick with normal parentheses `(` and `)`: no brackets or braces! 



To enter logical symbols on the keyboard, use:

------------------------- -----------------------------
not ~                     `-`, `~`
and &                     `/\`,  `&`
or âˆ¨                      `\/`, `v`
if then $\supset$                 `->`, `>`
if and only if $\equiv$          `<->`, `<>`
------------------------- -----------------------------

###Practice with *Carnap*! 

[testing out the give-credit="onSubmisson" to see what happens, and then if I later can delete points from this problem set so that they don't count toward grade]::

[note that the onsubmission thing didn't work probably b/c I spelled submission wrong lol. I missed the last `i' originally....]::

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer give-credit="onSubmission" points=2}
0.1 Feel free to practice entering the various truth-functional connectives on the keyboard! My preferred keystrokes are ~, &, v, >, <> since these are easier to type. Pressing "-" for negation could save you a shift key. Sentence letters for representing atomic sentences must be entered as CAPITALS, e.g. "P, Q, R, G, H, B, C". (We'll save lowercase letters up until "v" to represent constants when we're doing predicate logic, and "w, x, y, z" will be variables). 
```

##Directions (you'll see these a lot!):


When (and only when) you are happy with your answer, click the `Submit`
button. YOU CAN ONLY SUBMIT ONCE! So be careful! *Carnap* will then acknowledge and record your submission.

For problems that have a `Check` box, you can check your answer before submitting. Some low-point problems will actually REQUIRE your answer to be correct before allowing you to submit (this is to help make sure you know what you're doing for the later problems. It also grants you partial credit for later problems, which will floor at 50 percent if you attempt them).

If you have it correct, *Carnap* will highlight part of the problem in green, but you STILL HAVE TO CLICK `Submit`!

Higher-point problems will typically *not* have this *checking* feature, so really don't submit these until you're happy with your answer! There's no way in *Carnap* to resubmit answers! 

[For some of the low-point problems, *Carnap* will require you to get them correct before you can submit. This is to make sure that you are familiar with the system and not making any easily-preventable errors. ]:: 

*The fineprint*: Your student page on *Carnap* lists which problems you have completed.
You do not have to complete all problems at the same time; you can
come back to this page and complete part of the problem set later.
*However,* Carnap *will not save work on this page, and it won't show
which problems you already have submitted!* So you should
keep track of which problems are done, copy any work you want to
save, and paste it into a text document for later use or reference (but **not for sharing with others**---that's cheating!). You
can also print the problem page with completed problems, or take
screenshots.


[testing out options="exam", so hopefully no green check mark for this one if they enter anything]::

```{.QualitativeProblem .ShortAnswer options="exam" points=0}
1.2 Anything you'd like to tell me about your Carnap experience so far? Or concerns? (And thanks for scrolling through this page to help me check stuff!)
