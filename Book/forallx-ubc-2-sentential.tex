\chapter{Sentential logic}
\label{ch.SL}




This chapter introduces a logical language called SL. It is a version of \emph{sentential logic}, because the basic units of the language will represent entire sentences. (Recall from \S\ref{intro.sentences} that we're only considering propositional sentences.)



\section{Sentence letters}

In SL, capital Roman letters ($A$, $B$, $C$, etc.
are used to represent basic sentences.
Considered only as a symbol of SL, the letter $A$ could mean any sentence.
So when translating from English into SL, it is important to provide a \emph{symbolization key}.
The key provides an English language sentence for each sentence letter used in the symbolization.

For example, consider this argument:

\begin{earg}
\item[] Today is New Year's Day.
\item[] If today is New Year's Day, then people are swimming in English Bay.
\item[\therefore] People are swimming in English Bay.
\end{earg}

This is obviously a valid argument in English.
In symbolizing it, we want to preserve the structure of the argument that makes it valid.
What happens if we replace each sentence with a letter? Our symbolization key would look like this:

\begin{ekey}
\item[A:]Today is New Year's Day.
\item[B:]If today is New Year's Day, then people are swimming in English Bay.
\item[C:]People are swimming in English Bay.
\end{ekey}

We could then symbolize the argument in this way:

\begin{earg}
\item[] $A$
\item[] $B$
\item[\therefore] $C$
\end{earg}

This is a possible way to symbolize this argument, but it's not a very interesting one. 
There is no logical connection between $A$ and $B$, where these could be any sentences, and $C$, which could also be any sentence.
Something important about the argument has been lost in translation.
Whereas the original argument was valid, this translation of the argument does not reflect that validity.
For example, by using a different symbolization key, the following argument is also an instance of the logical form given above:

\begin{ekey}
\item[]Today is Christmas Day.
\item[]Tiny Tim has difficulty walking without crutches.
\item[\therefore]We're all going to die tomorrow.
\end{ekey}

A more interesting translation of the valid New Year's argument will show how it is different from the invalid Christmas argument.
The relevant thing about the New Year's argument is that the second premise is not just \emph{any} sentence.
Notice that the second premise contains the first premise and the conclusion \emph{as parts}.
Our symbolization key for the argument only needs to include meanings for $A$ and $C$, and we can build the second premise from those pieces.
So we symbolize the argument this way:

\begin{earg}
\item[] $A$
\item[] If $A$, then $C$.
\item[\therefore] $C$
\end{earg}

This preserves the logical structure of the argument that makes it valid by making use of the English expression `If$\ldots$ then$\ldots$'.
For our formal language, we ultimately want to replace all of the English expressions with logical notation, but this is a good start.

The sentences that can be symbolized with sentence letters are called \emph{atomic sentences}, because they are the basic building blocks out of which more complex sentences can be built.
Whatever logical structure a sentence might have is lost when it is translated as an atomic sentence.
From the point of view of SL, the sentence is just a letter.
It can be used to build more complex sentences, but it cannot be taken apart.

%Atomic sentences go together to make complex sentences in much the same way that physical atoms go together to make molecules. Physical atoms were originally called `atoms' because chemists thought that they were irreducible. Chemists were wrong, and physical atoms can be split.

%It is important to remember that a symbolization key only gives the meaning of atomic sentences for purposes of translating a specific argument.

We use capital Roman alphabet letters to represent SL sentences.\footnote{{\color{black} Later on, when we come to the logic of for-all and some, we will reserve \textit{lowercase} Roman alphabet letters for constants and variables. Hence, there is a \textit{good} reason why you will be forced to capitalize a lot of stuff on \textit{Carnap}. The caps are not optional!}} 
There are only twenty-six such letters.
We don't want to impose this artificial limit onto our formal language; it's better to work with a language that allows an arbitrary number of atomic sentences.
To achieve this, we allow atomic sentences that have a capital letter with a numeric subscript.
So we could have a symbolization key that looks like this:

\begin{ekey}
\item[A$_1$:] Aang is from the Air Nation.
\item[A$_2$:] Aang is vegetarian.
\item[A$_3$:] Aang can bend water.
\item[T$_1$:] Toph is blind.
\item[T$_2$:] Toph likes badgers.
\item[T$_3$:] Toph invented metal bending.
\end{ekey}

Keep in mind that each of these is a different atomic sentence.
Although it is often convenient (and aids memory) to use letters corresponding to the sentences' subject matters, as in the example above, no such requirement is built into the rules of SL.
There is no special relationship between $A_{1}$ and $A_{2}$, as far as SL goes.
It's just for our convenience that we might choose to make all the $A$ sentences about Aang.




\section{Connectives}

Logical connectives are used to build complex sentences from atomic components.
There are five logical connectives in SL.
This table summarizes them.
They are explained below.

\begin{table}[h]
\center
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
symbol&what it is called&rough translation\\
\hline
\enot&negation&`It is not the case that$\ldots$'\\
\eand&conjunction&`Both$\ldots$\ and $\ldots$'\\
\eor&disjunction&`Either$\ldots$\ or $\ldots$'\\
\eif&conditional&`If $\ldots$\ then $\ldots$'\\
\eiff&biconditional&`$\ldots$ if and only if $\ldots$'\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Natural languages like English are vague and imprecise, and carry many complex subtleties of meaning.
Our formal language SL has none of these properties.
It is defined by precise rigid rules.
Consequently, the `translation' provided in the table is only an approximate one.
We'll see some of the differences below.

\section{Negation}
Consider how we might symbolize these sentences:
\begin{earg}
\item[\ex{not1}] Logic is hard.
\item[\ex{not2}] It is false that logic is hard.
\item[\ex{not3}] Logic isn't hard.
\end{earg}

In order to symbolize sentence \ref{not1}, we will need one sentence letter.
We can provide a symbolization key:

\begin{ekey}
\item[H:]Logic is hard.
\end{ekey}

Now, sentence \ref{not1} is simply $H$. 

Since sentence \ref{not2} is obviously related to sentence \ref{not1}, we do not want to introduce a different sentence letter.
To put it partly in English, the sentence means `It is false that $H$.
In order to symbolize this, we need a symbol for logical negation.
We will use `\enot.'
Now we can translate `Not $H$' to `$\enot H$'.
In general, `\enot' means `It is false that' or `It is not the case that'.

A sentence of this type--- one that begins with a `\enot' symbol--- is called a \define{negation}.
The sentence it negates, in this case $H$, is called the \define{negand}.

What of Sentence \ref{not3}? It looks like a more natural  way of saying the same thing as sentence \ref{not2}.
It's saying that logic isn't hard, which is just another way of negating the proposition that logic is hard.
So sentences \ref{not2} and \ref{not3} have the same truth conditions.
In the terminology of Ch.\ \ref{ch.intro}, they are logically equivalent.
So we can translate both sentence \ref{not2} and sentence \ref{not3} as: $\enot H$.

When translating from English into SL, the word `not' is usually a pretty good clue that `\enot' will be an appropriate symbol to use.
But it's important to think about the actual meaning of the sentence, and not rely too much on which words appear in it.

\factoidbox{
For any sentence \metaA{}, a sentence can be symbolized as $\enot\metaA{}$ if it can be paraphrased in English as `It is not the case that \metaA{}.'}

(For more on the `\metaA{}' notation, see the `note about notation' on p.\ \pageref{notationnote}.)

Consider these further examples:

\begin{earg}
\item[\ex{not4}] Rodrigo is mortal.
\item[\ex{not5}] Rodrigo is immortal.
\item[\ex{not5b}] Rodrigo is not immortal.
\end{earg}

If we let `$R$' mean `Rodrigo is mortal', then sentence \ref{not4} can be translated as: $R$.

What about sentence \ref{not5}? Being immortal is pretty much the same as not being mortal.
So it makes sense to treat \ref{not5} as the negation of \ref{not4}, symbolizing it as $\enot{R}$.

Sentence \ref{not5b} can be paraphrased as `It is not the case that Rodrigo is immortal.
Using negation twice, we translate this as $\enot \enot R$.
The two negations in a row each work as negations, so the sentence means `It is not the case that$\ldots$ it is not the case that$\ldots$ $R$.
It is the negation of the negation of $R$.
One can negate \emph{any} sentence of SL --- even a negation --- by putting the `\enot{}' symbol in front of it.
It's not only for atomic sentences.
In the case of $\enot\enot R$, this is a negation whose negand is $\enot R$, which in turn is a negation whose negand is $R$.

Here is an example that illustrates some of the complexities of translation.

\begin{earg}
\item[\ex{not6}] Elliott is happy.
\item[\ex{not7}] Elliott is unhappy.
\end{earg}

If we let $H$ mean `Elliot is happy', then we can symbolize sentence \ref{not6} as $H$.

We might be tempted to symbolize sentence \ref{not7} as $\enot{H}$.
But is being unhappy the same thing as not being happy? 
No! 
Elliott might simply be meh.
If you find out that someone is not happy, you cannot infer that they are unhappy.
Hence, we shouldn't treat \ref{not7} as the negation of \ref{not6}.
If we're allowing that `unhappy' means something different from `not happy', then we need to use a different atomic sentence to translate \ref{not7}.

What of the \emph{truth conditions} for negated sentences?

For any sentence \metaA{}: If \metaA{} is true, then \enot\metaA{} is false.
If \metaA{} is false, then \enot\metaA{} is true.
Using `1' for true and `0' for false, we can summarize this in a \emph{truth table} for negation:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c}
\metaA{} & \enot\metaA{}\\
\hline
1 & 0\\
0 & 1 
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The left column shows the possible truth values for the negand; the right column shows the truth value of the negation.
By using numeral digits, we avoid any clash with our atomic sentence letters.\footnote{Note that \textit{Carnap} will not have this virtue: truth tables will use `T' for \textit{true} and `F' for \textit{false}.}
We will discuss truth tables at greater length in Chapter \ref{ch.TruthTables}.



\section{Conjunction}

Consider these sentences:

\begin{earg}
\item[\ex{and1}]Jessica is strong.
\item[\ex{and2}]Luke is strong.
\item[\ex{and3}]Jessica is strong, and Luke is also strong.
\end{earg}

We will need separate sentence letters for \ref{and1} and \ref{and2}, so we define this symbolization key:
\begin{ekey}
\item[J:] Jessica is strong.
\item[L:] Luke is strong.
\end{ekey}

Sentence \ref{and1}, of course, is simply symbolized as $J$, and sentence \ref{and2} is symbolized as $L$.

Sentence \ref{and3} can be paraphrased as `$J$ and $L$.'
In order to fully symbolize this sentence, we need another symbol.
We will use `\eand'.
We translate `$J$ and $L$' as ($J\eand L$).
The logical connective `\eand' is called \define{conjunction}, and $J$ and $L$ are each called \define{conjuncts}.

Notice that we make no attempt to symbolize `also' in sentence \ref{and3}.
Words like `both' and `also' function to draw our attention to the fact that two things are being conjoined but are not doing any further logical work.
Thus we do not need to represent `both' and `also' in SL.
Note that Sentence \ref{and3} would have meant the same thing had it simply said `Jessica is strong, and Luke is strong,' or even if we dropped the `and' entirely and used a semicolon: `Jessica is strong; Luke is strong'.

Here are some more examples:

\begin{earg}
\item[\ex{and4}]Jessica is strong and grumpy.
\item[\ex{and5}]Jessica and Matt are both strong.
\item[\ex{and6}]Although Luke is strong, he is not grumpy.
\item[\ex{and7}]Matt is strong, but Jessica is stronger than Matt.
\end{earg}

Sentence \ref{and4} is a conjunction.
The sentence says two things about Jessica, so in English it is natural to use her name only once.
It might be tempting to try this when translating the argument: Since $J$ means `Jessica is strong', one might attempt to paraphrase sentence \ref{and4} as `$J$ and grumpy'.
But this would be a mistake.
Once we translate part of a sentence as $J$, any further structure within the original sentence is lost.
$J$ is an atomic sentence and SL doesn't keep track of the fact that it was intended to be about Jessica.
Moreover, `grumpy' is not a sentence; on its own it is neither true nor false.
So instead, we paraphrase sentence \ref{and4} as the conjunction $J \eand G_{1}$ where $G_{1}$ has been added to the symbolization key and translates to `Jessica is grumpy.'
More generally, we may say that:

\factoidbox{
A sentence can be symbolized as ($\metaA{}\eand\metaB{}$) if it can be paraphrased in English as `Both \metaA{}, and \metaB{}.' Each of the conjuncts must be a sentence.
}

Sentence \ref{and5} says one thing about two different subjects.
It says of both Jessica and Matt that they are strong, and in English we use the word `strong' only once.
In translating to SL, we want to make sure each conjunct is a sentence on its own, so once again, we'll paraphrase it by repeating the elements: `Jessica is strong, and Matt is strong.
Once we add a new atomic sentence $M$ for `Matt is strong', this translates to $J\eand M$.

Sentence \ref{and6} is a bit more complicated.
The word `although' tends to suggest a kind of contrast between the first part of the sentence and the second part.
Nevertheless, the sentence is still telling us two things: Luke is strong, and he's not grumpy.
So we can paraphrase sentence \ref{and6} as, `\emph{Both} Luke is strong, \emph{and} Luke is not grumpy.
The second conjunct contains a negation, so we paraphrase further: `\emph{Both} Luke is strong \emph{and} \emph{it is not the case that} Luke is grumpy.'
Letting $G_{2}$ stand for `Luke is grumpy', and we can translate sentence \ref{and6} as $L\eand\enot G_{2}$.

Once again, this is an imperfect translation of the English sentence \ref{and6}.
That sentence suggested that there was a contrast between Luke's two properties.
Our translation merely says that he has both of them.
Still, it is a translation that preserves some of the important features of the original, specifically the logical features.
That is, the sentences says that Luke is strong, and it also says that he's not grumpy.

Sentence \ref{and7}'s use of the word `but' indicates a similar contrastive structure.
It is irrelevant for the purpose of translating to SL, so we can paraphrase the sentence as `\emph{Both} Matt is strong, \emph{and} Jessica is stronger than Matt.
How should we translate the second conjunct? 
We already have the sentence letters $J$ and $M$, but neither of these says anything comparative.
We need a new sentence letter.
Let $S$ mean `Jessica is stronger than Matt.'
Now the sentence translates as ($M \eand S$).\footnote{In Chapter~\ref{ch.QL}, we will learn an even better way to translate relations. All in due course!}

\factoidbox{Sentences that can be paraphrased `\metaA{}, but \metaB{}' or `Although \metaA{}, \metaB{}' are best symbolized using conjunction: (\metaA{}\eand\metaB{}).
}

It is important to keep in mind that the sentence letters $J$, $M$, $G_{1}$, $G_{2}$, and $S$ are atomic sentences.
Considered as symbols of SL, they have no meaning beyond being true or false.
We used $J$ and $M$ to symbolize different English language sentences that are about people being strong, but this similarity is completely lost when we translate to SL.
Nor does SL recognize any particular similarity between $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$.

For any two sentences \metaA{} and \metaB{}, the conjunction (\metaA{}\eand\metaB{}) is true if and only if the conjuncts --- \metaA{} and \metaB{} --- are both true. We can summarize this in the \textit{truth table} for conjunction:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
\metaA{} & \metaB{} & (\metaA{}\eand\metaB{})\\
\hline
1 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The two left columns indicate the truth values of the conjuncts.
Since there are four possible combinations of truth values, there are four rows.
The conjunction is true when both conjuncts are true, and false otherwise.

Note that conjunction is commutative: (\metaA{}\eand\metaB{}) is logically equivalent to (\metaB{}\eand\metaA{}).
Is `and' in English commutative?
Consider the following claims:

\begin{earg}
\item[\ex{and8}] Dan went home and took a shower.
\item[\ex{and9}] Dan took a shower and went home.
\end{earg}

Do these sentences mean the same thing?
Not really.
Often the order of the conjuncts suggests the temporal order of the events.
Accordingly, we may take \ref{and8} to claim that \textit{first} Dan went home, and only \textit{then} did he take a shower, whereas \ref{and9} says that these happened in the opposite order.
But what of our truth table for conjunction?

Although SL helps to identify certain logical features in English, it cannot recover everything that we might want to recover.
This doesn't mean that one can't provide a non-commutative theory of conjunction, but we won't be providing such a theory in this course.
Rather we stipulate that the sort of conjunction that we are interested in for the purposes of this course is commutative where the truth table for conjunction encodes this stipulation.
This doesn't make the commutative theory of conjunction less interesting than a non-commutative theory.
Indeed, simplicity is a good thing, providing for broad applications where a non-commutative notion of conjunction may get in the way.
For instance, consider mathematical claims: assuming all such claims are eternal, none are before others, and so we don't need to keep track of temporal order.
Even if one were concerned to encode temporal order, getting to grips with SL and QL as we will in this course is the place to start.




\subsection{A Note About Notation}
\label{notationnote}

In speaking generally about connectives, we've used the symbols `\metaA{}' and `\metaB{}' as variables to stand in for arbitrary sentences of SL.
We saw, for instance, that for any sentence \metaA{}, we may consider the negation \enot\metaA{} of \metaA{}.
This means:

\begin{itemize}
\item \enot $A$ is the negation of $A$
\item \enot $B_1$ is the negation of $B_1$
\item \enot $B_2$ is the negation of $B_2$
\item \enot \enot $C$ is the negation of \enot $C$
\item \enot $(A \eand B)$ is the negation of $(A\eand B)$
\item etc.
\end{itemize}

Note that \metaA{} and \metaB{} are \emph{not} sentences of SL.
They are called \textit{schematic variables} which, in this case, have sentences as values.
Schematic variables allow us to talk about all SL sentences, but they're not themselves sentences of SL.
Compare the use of variables like `$x$' in algebra.
An `$x$' symbol is used to stand in for any number, but `$x$' is not itself a name for a number the way that `2' is a name for the number two.
We'll return to this distinction in \S\ref{sec:sentencesofSL}, and again later on when we discuss proving general facts \textit{about} SL.





\section{Disjunction}

Consider these sentences:

\begin{earg}
\item[\ex{or1}]Denison will golf with me or he will watch movies.
\item[\ex{or2}]Either Denison or Ellery will golf with me. 
\end{earg}

For these sentences we can use this symbolization key:

\begin{ekey}
\item[D:] Denison will golf with me.
\item[E:] Ellery will golf with me.
\item[M:] Denison will watch movies.
\end{ekey}

Sentence \ref{or1} is `Either $D$ or $M$.
To fully symbolize this, we introduce a new symbol.
The sentence becomes $(D \eor M)$.
The `\eor' connective is called \define{disjunction}, and $D$ and $M$ are called \define{disjuncts}.
`\eor' stands for an \emph{inclusive or}, which means it is true if and only if \emph{at least one disjunct} is true.

Sentence \ref{or2} is only slightly more complicated.
There are two subjects, but the English sentence only gives the verb once.
In translating, we can paraphrase it as `Either Denison will golf with me, or Ellery will golf with me.'
Now it obviously translates as $(D \eor E$).

\factoidbox{
A sentence can be symbolized as $(\metaA{}\eor\metaB{})$ if it can be paraphrased in English as `Either \metaA{}, or \metaB{}.' Each of the disjuncts must be a sentence.
}

Since $\eor$ is our symbol, which we have introduced into SL, we get to \textit{stipulate} its truth conditions.
And we stipulate that we are using inclusive or, so that $A \eor B$ is true provided that at least one disjunct is true, including the scenario where both are true.
Is this a good stipulation for how to treat `or'?
In a study of the semantics of English, it would be appropriate to pursue this question much further.
But this book is about logic, not linguistics.
Rather than concerning ourselves with describing the exact patterns by which `or' in English is used, we will be concerned to identify a formal analogue which is simpler and more consistent in its use.

So $(D \eor E)$ is true if $D$ is true, if $E$ is true, or if both $D$ and $E$ are true. It is false only if both $D$ and $E$ are false. We can summarize this with the \textit{truth table} for disjunction:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
\metaA{} & \metaB{} & (\metaA{}\eor\metaB{}) \\
\hline
1 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 0 & 1\\
0 & 1 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 0
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The following sentences are somewhat more complicated:

\begin{earg}
\item[\ex{or3}] Either you will not have soup, or you will not have salad.
\item[\ex{or4}] You will have neither soup nor salad.
\item[\ex{or5}] You get soup or salad, but not both.
\end{earg}

Here's a symbolization key:

\begin{ekey}
\item[S$_1$:] You will get soup.
\item[S$_2$:] You will get salad.
\end{ekey}

Sentence \ref{or3} can be paraphrased in this way: `Either \emph{it is not the case that} you get soup, or \emph{it is not the case that} you get salad.' 
Translating this requires both disjunction and negation.
It is a disjunction of two negations: $(\enot S_1 \eor \enot S_2)$.

Sentence \ref{or4} also requires negation.
It can be paraphrased as, `\emph{It is not the case that} either that you get soup or that you get salad.
In other words, it is the negation of a disjunction.
We need some way of indicating that the negation does not just negate the right or left disjunct; the entire disjunction is the negand.
In order to do this, we put parentheses around the disjunction: `It is not the case that $(S_1 \eor S_2)$.
This becomes simply $\enot (S_1 \eor S_2)$.\footnote{A second, equivalent, way to translate this sentence is $(\enot S_1 \eand \enot S_2)$. We'll see why this is equivalent later on. The equivalence of $\enot (A \eor B)$ and $(\enot A \eand \enot B)$ is one of De Morgan's laws.}
Notice that the parentheses are doing important work here. The sentence $(\enot S_1 \eor S_2)$ would mean `Either you will not have soup, or you will have salad,' which is very different.

Sentence \ref{or5} has a more complex structure.
We can break it into two parts.
The first part says that you get one or the other.
We translate this as $(S_1 \eor S_2)$.
The second part says that you do not get both.
We can paraphrase this as, `It is not the case that you both get soup and get salad.
Using both negation and conjunction, we translate this as $\enot(S_1 \eand S_2)$.
Now we just need to put the two parts together.
As we saw above, `but' can usually be translated as a conjunction.
Sentence \ref{or5} can thus be translated as $((S_1 \eor S_2) \eand \enot(S_1 \eand S_2))$.

\section{The Material Conditional}
For the following sentences, use this symbolization key:

\begin{ekey}
\item[R:] You will cut the red wire.
\item[B:] The bomb will explode.
\end{ekey}

\begin{earg}
\item[\ex{if1}] If you cut the red wire, then the bomb will explode.
\item[\ex{if2}] The bomb will explode only if you cut the red wire.
\end{earg}

Sentence \ref{if1} can be translated partially as `If $R$, then $B$.' We will use the horseshoe symbol `\eif' to represent this conditional relationship. The sentence becomes $(R\eif B)$. The connective is called a \define{conditional}. The sentence on the left-hand side of the conditional ($R$ in this example) is called the \define{antecedent}. The sentence on the right-hand side ($B$) is called the \define{consequent}. Memorize these words!!!! (`ante' for before; think `consequence' for `consequent')

Sentence \ref{if2} is also a conditional. Since the word `if' appears in the second half of the sentence, it might be tempting to symbolize this in the same way as sentence \ref{if1}. That would be a BIG mistake.

The conditional $(R\eif B)$ says that \emph{if} $R$ were true, \emph{then} $B$ would also be true. It does not say that your cutting the red wire is the \emph{only} way that the bomb could explode. Someone else might cut the wire, or the bomb might be on a timer. The sentence $(R\eif B)$ does not say anything about what to expect if $R$ is false. 
Sentence \ref{if2} is different. It says that the only conditions under which the bomb will explode are ones where you cut the red wire; i.e., if the bomb explodes, then you must have cut the wire. As such, sentence \ref{if2} should be symbolized as $(B \eif R)$. 

Notice though that for both sentences, we have the same antecedent/consequent pattern: the atomic sentence before the `only if' is the antecdent.' The atomic sentence after the `only if' is the consequent. Hence, we could also write sentence \ref{if1} as `You cut the red wire only if the bomb will explode', which we would also symbolize as $(R\eif B)$. In logic land, this means the same thing as saying `If you cut the red wire, then the bomb will explode.' You'll have to get used to this! 
%This is equivalent to saying that if you did not cut the red wire, then the bomb would not explode, which we'll call the contrapositive of the conditional. 

It is important to remember that the connective `\eif' says only that, if the antecedent is true, then the consequent is true. It says nothing about the \emph{causal} connection between the two events. Translating sentence \ref{if2} as $(B \eif R)$ does not mean that the bomb exploding would somehow have caused your cutting the wire. Both sentence \ref{if1} and \ref{if2} suggest that, if you cut the red wire, your cutting the red wire would be the cause of the bomb exploding. They differ on the \emph{logical} connection. If sentence \ref{if2} were true, then an explosion would tell us --- those of us safely away from the bomb --- that you had cut the red wire. Without an explosion, sentence \ref{if2} tells us nothing about what you did with the wire.

The paraphrased sentence `\metaA{} only if \metaB{}' is logically equivalent to `If \metaA{}, then \metaB{}.'
}

% Could discuss necessary and sufficient conditions here.

When the sentence `If \metaA{} then \metaB{}' is true, this means that if \metaA{} is true then so is \metaB{}. Hence, if the antecedent \metaA{} is true but the consequent \metaB{} is false, then the conditional `If \metaA{} then \metaB{}' is false. What is the truth value of `If \metaA{} then \metaB{}' under other circumstances? Suppose, for instance, that the antecedent \metaA{} happened to be false. `If \metaA{} then \metaB{}' would then not tell us anything about the actual truth value of the consequent \metaB{}, and at least in ordinary English it is unclear what the truth value of `If \metaA{} then \metaB{}' would be. 

{\color{black}But in logic we get to stipulate, and we will stipulate that whenever the antecedent \metaA{} is false, the conditional  `If \metaA{} then \metaB{}' is true. Now believe me, the following sentence is false---it will never happen: `I am going to be a successful popstar'. Hence, the following conditional is true: `If Josh Hunt becomes a successful popstar, then everyone will get an A+ in Logic this semester'. Even though this conditional is true, you're not going to boost your grade by supporting my vocal training! When the antecedent is false, we say that the conditional is \textit{trivially} true. Such conditionals are true, but in a rather uninteresting sense.} 

%JH: I remember being really frustrated by this when I first took logic, and I don't know what else to tell you. This material conditional works really well for formalizing a bunch of arguments in natural language and mathematics. If you want to know what conditionals really mean, you'll have to study a lot more philosophy (especially counterfactuals). And you'll find that, like most things in philosophy, it is extremely controversial what they mean.

In English, the truth of conditionals often depends on what \emph{would} be the case if the antecedent \emph{were true} --- even if, as a matter of fact, the antecedent is false. This poses a serious challenge for translating conditionals into SL.  Considered as sentences of SL, $R$ and $B$ in the above examples have nothing intrinsically to do with each other. In order to consider what the world would be like if $R$ were true, we would need to analyze what $R$ says about the world {\color{black}(and we are quickly led into deep questions about the way the world is, laws of nature, and counterfactual reasoning---topics for metaphysics, philosophy of science, and philosophy of language, but not this class)}. Since $R$ is an atomic symbol of SL, however, there is no further structure to be analyzed. When we replace a sentence with a sentence letter, we consider it merely as some atomic sentence that might be true or false.

In order to translate conditionals into SL, we will not try to capture all the subtleties of the English `if$\ldots$ then$\ldots$' construction. Instead, the symbol `\eif' will signify a \emph{material conditional}. This means that when \metaA{} is false, the conditional (\metaA{}\eif\metaB{}) is automatically true, regardless of the truth value of \metaB{}. If both \metaA{} and \metaB{} are true, then the conditional (\metaA{}\eif\metaB{}) is true.


In short, (\metaA{}\eif\metaB{}) is false if and only if \metaA{} is true and \metaB{} is false. We can summarize this with a characteristic truth table for the conditional {\color{black}(MEMORIZE THIS TABLE, especially the second line!!! at least within a week or two).}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
\metaA{} & \metaB{} & \metaA{}\eif\metaB{}\\
\hline
1 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 1\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

More than any other connective, the SL translation of the conditional is a rough approximation. It has some very counterintuitive consequences about the truth-values of conditionals. You can see from the truth table, for example, that an SL conditional is true any time the consequent is true, no matter what the antecedent is. (Look at lines 1 and 3 in the chart.) And it is also true any time the antecedent is false, no matter what the consequent is. (Look at lines 3 and 4.) This is an odd consequence. In English, some conditionals with true consequents and/or false antecedents seem clearly to be false. For example:

\begin{earg}
\item[\ex{pmc1}] If there are no philosophy courses at UBC, then PHIL 220 is a philosophy course at UBC.
\item[\ex{pmc2}] If this book has fewer than thirty pages, then it will win the 2018 Pulitzer prize for poetry.
\end{earg}

Both \ref{pmc1} and \ref{pmc2} seem clearly false. But each of them, translated into SL, would come out true. (If this isn't obvious, it's worth taking a moment to translate them and consider the truth table.) I told you before that English translations into SL are only approximate! Despite these odd results, the approach to conditionals offered here actually preserves many of the most important logical features of conditionals. We'll see this in more detail once we start working with proofs. For now, I'll just ask you to go along with this approach to conditionals, even though it will seem strange. Resistance will prove futile! 

Note that unlike conjunction and disjunction, the conditional is \emph{asymmetrical}. You cannot swap the antecedent and consequent without changing the meaning of the sentence, because (\metaA{}\eif\metaB{}) and (\metaB{}\eif\metaA{}) are not logically equivalent.

%\begin{earg}
%\item[\ex{if3}] Everytime a bell rings, an angel earns its wings.
%\item[\ex{if4}] Bombs always explode when you cut the red wire.
%\end{earg}

%Not all sentences of the form `If$\ldots$ then$\ldots$' are conditionals. Consider this sentence:
%
%\begin{earg}
%\item[\ex{if5}] If anyone wants to see me, then I will be on the porch.
%\end{earg}
%
%If I say this, it means that I will be on the porch, regardless of whether anyone wants to see me or not --- but if someone did want to see me, then they should look for me there. If we let $P$ mean `I will be on the porch,' then sentence \ref{if5} can be translated simply as $P$.
%

\section{Biconditional}
Consider these sentences:
\begin{earg}
\item[\ex{iff1}] The figure on the board is a triangle only if it has exactly three sides.
\item[\ex{iff2}] The figure on the board is a triangle if it has exactly three sides.
\item[\ex{iff3}] The figure on the board is a triangle if and only if it has exactly three sides.
\end{earg}

\begin{ekey}
\item[T:] The figure is a triangle.
\item[S:] The figure has three sides.
\end{ekey}

Sentence \ref{iff1}, for reasons discussed above, can be translated as $(T\eif S)$.

Sentence \ref{iff2} is importantly different. It can be paraphrased as, `If the figure has three sides, then it is a triangle.' So it can be translated as $(S\eif T$).\footnote{{\color{black}The trick here is that if you see a sentence `Q if P', this is equivalent to `if P, then Q'. Very different from `Q only if P', which is equivalent to `if Q, then P.' Remember: `if' and `only if' are VERY different.}}

Sentence \ref{iff3} says that $T$ is true \emph{if and only if} $S$ is true; we can infer $S$ from $T$, and we can infer $T$ from $S$. This is called a \define{biconditional}, because it entails the two conditionals $S\eif T$ and $T \eif S$. We will use `\eiff' to represent the biconditional; sentence \ref{iff3} can be translated as $(S \eiff T)$.

We could abide without a new symbol for the biconditional. Since sentence \ref{iff3} means `$(T \eif S)$ and $(S\eif T)$,' we could translate it as a conjunction of those two conditionals --- as $((T \eif S)\eand(S\eif T))$. Notice how the parentheses work: we technically need to add a new set of parentheses for the conjunction, in addition to the ones that were already there for the conditionals.

Because we could always write $((\metaA{}\eif\metaB{})\eand(\metaB{}\eif\metaA{}))$ instead of $(\metaA{}\eiff\metaB{})$, we do not strictly speaking \emph{need} to introduce a new symbol for the biconditional.\footnote{{\color{black}Indeed, as we might discuss, you can actually do everything in SL with a SINGLE connective called `nand' (not-both) or the `Sheffer stroke'. And you can also get by with just negation and conjunction, or just negation and disjunction. Doing so would be very tedious! Question: how many truth-functionally distinct binary connectives could we define?}} Nevertheless, logical languages usually have such a symbol. SL will have one, which makes it easier to translate phrases like `if and only if.'

$(\metaA{}\eiff\metaB{})$ is true if and only if \metaA{} and \metaB{} have the same truth value: they're either both true, or they're both false. This is the characteristic truth table for the biconditional:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
\metaA{} & \metaB{} & \metaA{}\eiff\metaB{}\\
\hline
1 & 1 & 1\\
1 & 0 & 0\\
0 & 1 & 0\\
0 & 0 & 1
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


\section{Other symbolization}
We have now introduced all of the connectives of SL. We can use them together to translate many kinds of sentences. Consider these examples of sentences that use the English-language connective `unless', with an associated symbolization key:

\begin{earg}
\item[\ex{unless1}] Unless you wear a jacket, you will catch a cold. 
\item[\ex{unless2}] You will catch a cold unless you wear a jacket. 
\end{earg}


\begin{ekey}
\item[J:] You will wear a jacket.
\item[D:] You will catch a cold.
\end{ekey}

We can paraphrase sentence \ref{unless1} as `Unless $J$, $D$.' This means that if you do not wear a jacket, then you will catch a cold; with this in mind, we might translate it as $\enot J \eif D$. {\color{black} Intuitively, `unless $J$' means `if not $J$, then \dots'.} 

This same sentence \ref{unless1} also means that if you do not catch a cold, then you must have worn a jacket. With this in mind, we might translate it as $\enot D \eif J$. Which of these is the correct translation of sentence \ref{unless1}? Both translations are correct, because the two translations are logically equivalent in SL {\color{black}(they are each the `contrapositive' of the other: the contrapositive of $P \eif Q$ is $\enot Q \eif \enot P$, i.e. you flip the order and negate both atomic sentences. This is also something that you'll soon want to MEMORIZE. It is INCREDIBLY important for reasoning, both ordinary and in mathematics).}

Sentence \ref{unless2} (`You will catch a cold unless you wear a jacket') is logically equivalent to sentence \ref{unless1}. It means the same thing as saying `Unless you wear a jacket, you will catch a cold.' Hence, it can also be translated as either $\enot J \eif D$ or $\enot D \eif J$.

When symbolizing sentences like sentence \ref{unless1} and sentence \ref{unless2}, it is easy to get turned around. Since the conditional is not symmetric, it would be wrong to translate either sentence as $J \eif \enot D$. Fortunately, there are other logically equivalent expressions. Both sentences mean that you will wear a jacket or --- if you do not wear a jacket --- then you will catch a cold. So we can translate them both as $J \eor D$ {\color{black}(Although linguistically less natural, this translation is the EASY ONE TO REMEMBER. So I recommend memorizing this translation for `unless.' Translate `P unless Q' as `$Q \eor P$', and you won't go wrong. It helps that  `$Q \eor P$' is logically equivalent to `$P \eor Q$', so if you use disjunction, you don't have to worry about the order)}.


\factoidbox{
If a sentence can be paraphrased as `Unless \metaA{}, \metaB{},' then it can be symbolized as $(\enot\metaA{}\eif\metaB{})$, $(\enot\metaB{}\eif\metaA{})$, or $(\metaA{}\eor\metaB{})$ (memorize this last one!).
}

Symbolization of standard sentence types is summarized on p.~\pageref{app.notation}.





\section{Sentences of SL}
\label{sec:sentencesofSL}
The sentence `Apples are red, or berries are blue' is a sentence of English, and the sentence `$(A\eor B)$' is a sentence of SL. Although we can identify sentences of English when we encounter them, we do not have a formal definition of `English sentence'. (Students used to learn grammarians' attempts to formalize some such rules, but contemporary linguists agree that this was a hopeless project. Natural languages like English are just not susceptible to such precisification.) In SL, it is possible to formally define what counts as a sentence. This is one respect in which a formal language like SL is more precise than a natural language like English.

It is important to distinguish between the logical language SL, which we are developing, and the language that we use to talk about SL. When we talk about a language, the language that we are talking about is called the \define{object language}. The language that we use to talk about the object language is called the \define{metalanguage}.
\label{def.metalanguage}

The object language in this chapter is SL. The metalanguage is English --- not conversational English, but English supplemented with some logical and mathematical vocabulary (including the `\metaA{}' and `\metaB{}' symbols). The sentence `$(A\eor B)$' is a sentence in the object language, because it uses only symbols of SL. The word `sentence' is not itself part of SL, however, so the sentence `This expression is a sentence of SL' is not a sentence of SL. It is a sentence in the metalanguage, a sentence that we use to talk \emph{about} SL.

In this section, we will give a formal definition for `sentence of SL.' The definition itself will be given in mathematical English, the metalanguage.

\subsection{Expressions}

There are three kinds of symbols in SL:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
sentence letters & $A,B,C,\ldots,Z$\\
with subscripts, as needed & $A_1, B_1,Z_1,A_2,A_{25},J_{375},\ldots$\\
\hline
connectives & \enot,\eand,\eor,\eif,\eiff\\
\hline
parentheses&( , )\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

We define an \define{expression of SL} as any string of symbols of SL. Take any of the symbols of SL and write them down, in any order, and you have an expression.


\subsection{Well-formed formulae}
\label{sec:wff}

Since any sequence of symbols is an expression, many expressions of SL will be nonsense. For example, the following expressions don't mean anything: {\color{black}they lack truth conditions. They don't even rise to the level where they might be false: they are simply meaningless.}

\begin{earg}
\item[] \enot\enot\enot\enot
\item[] ))\eiff
\item[] $A_4$ \eor
\end{earg}

None of these are sentences in SL. A meaningful expression is called a \define{well-formed formula}. It is common to use the acronym \emph{wff}; the plural is wffs. (It is pronounced like the canine onomatopoeia.)

Atomic sentence letters like $A$ and $G_{13}$ are certainly wffs. We can form further wffs out of these by using the various connectives. Using negation, we can get $\enot A$ and $\enot G_{13}$. Using conjunction, we can get $(A \eand G_{13})$, $(G_{13} \eand A)$, $(A \eand A)$, and $(G_{13} \eand G_{13})$. We could also apply negation repeatedly to get wffs like $\enot \enot A$ or apply negation along with conjunction to get wffs like $\enot(A \eand G_{13})$ and $\enot(G_{13} \eand \enot G_{13})$. The possible combinations are endless, even starting with just these two sentence letters, and there are infinitely many sentence letters. So there is no point in trying to list all the wffs.\footnote{{\color{black} Although, if intelligent agents exist for finite time in the universe, then there may only ever be a finite number of wffs written down. Regardless, there are an infinite number of wffs that \textit{could} be written down. The meaning of this `could' raises philosophical issues about possibility, a facet of what philosophers call `modality'.}} 

But we can still describe the rules that govern the construction of wffs. {\color{black}These rules will matter a great deal in our later adventures in metalogic.} Consider negation: Given any wff \metaA{} of SL, $\enot\metaA{}$ is a wff of SL. Remember, \metaA{} is not itself a sentence letter; it is a variable that stands in for any wff at all (atomic or not). Since the variable \metaA{} is not a symbol of SL, $\enot\metaA{}$ is not an expression of SL. Instead, it is an expression of the metalanguage that allows us to talk about infinitely many expressions of SL: all of the expressions that start with the negation symbol. Because \metaA{} is part of the metalanguage, it is called a \emph{metavariable}. {\color{black}(Logicians across the country have recently become concerned that Facebook's parent company might soon trademark our metalanguages, suing us out of existence!)}

Another way of saying that given any wff \metaA{} of SL, $\enot\metaA{}$ is a wff of SL is to say that any time you have a wff of SL, you can make a new wff by adding a `\enot' symbol to the front of it. {\color{black} This is an instance of a \textit{recursive definition}. We are recursively defining the negated sentences in terms of previous sentences that could be constructed.}

We can say similar things for each of the other connectives. For instance, if \metaA{} and \metaB{} are wffs of SL, then $(\metaA{}\eand\metaB{})$ is a wff of SL. (That is to say, given any two wffs in SL, you can put a `\eand' symbol between them, a `(' in front of the first, and a `)' after the second, and the whole thing will add up to a new wff.)  Providing clauses like this for all of the connectives, we arrive at the following formal definition for a {well-formed formula of SL}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Every atomic sentence is a wff.
\item For all expressions \metaA{} and \metaB{},
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item If \metaA{} is a wff, then $\enot\metaA{}$ is a wff.
		\item If \metaA{} and \metaB{} are wffs, then $(\metaA{}\eand\metaB{})$ is a wff.
		\item If \metaA{} and \metaB{} are wffs, then $(\metaA{}\eor\metaB{})$ is a wff.
		\item If \metaA{} and \metaB{} are wffs, then $(\metaA{}\eif\metaB{})$ is a wff.
		\item If \metaA{} and \metaB{} are wffs, then $(\metaA{}\eiff\metaB{})$ is a wff.
	\end{enumerate}
\item Nothing else is a wff.
\end{enumerate}

This is a \emph{recursive} definition of a wff, illustrating how one can, starting with the simplest cases (atomic sentences), build up more complicated sentences of SL. If you have a wff, you can stick a `\enot' in front of it to make a new wff. If you have two wffs, you can put a `(' in front of the first one, followed by a `\eand', followed by the second one, then finally a `)', and end up with a new wff. Etc.

Note that these are purely \emph{syntactic} rules. They tell you how to construct an admissible (`grammatical') sentence in SL. They do not tell you what the sentence will \emph{mean}. (We've touched on that already, in introducing characteristic truth tables. We'll return to this topic in much more detail in Ch. \ref{ch.TruthTables}.)

Suppose we want to know whether or not $\enot \enot \enot D$ is a wff of SL. Looking at the second clause of the definition, we know that $\enot \enot \enot D$ is a wff \emph{if} $\enot \enot D$ is a wff. So now we need to ask whether or not $\enot \enot D$ is a wff. Again looking at the second clause of the definition, $\enot \enot D$ is a wff \emph{if} $\enot D$ is. Again, $\enot D$ is a wff \emph{if} $D$ is a wff. Now $D$ is a sentence letter, an atomic sentence of SL, so we know that $D$ is a wff by the first clause of the definition. So for a compound formula like $\enot \enot \enot D$, we must apply the definition repeatedly. Eventually we arrive at the atomic sentences from which the wff is built up.

The connective that you look to first in decomposing a sentence is called the \define{main connective} (or \emph{main logical operator}) of that sentence. For example: The main connective of $\enot (E \eor (F \eif G))$ is negation, \enot. The main connective of $(\enot E \eor (F \eif G))$ is disjunction, \eor. Conversely, if you're building up a wff from simpler sentences, the connective introduced by the last rule you apply is the main connective. It is the connective that governs the interpretation of the entire sentence. {\color{black} Ultimately, you will have to become VERY COMFORTABLE identifying the main connective of sometimes convoluted sentences in SL. Otherwise, you will not be able to determine what it takes for such sentences to be true or false.}


\subsection{Sentences}
Recall that a sentence is a meaningful expression that can be true or false. Since the meaningful expressions of SL are the wffs and since every wff of SL is either true or false, the definition for a sentence of SL is the same as the definition for a wff. (Not every formal language will have this nice feature. In the language for quantifier logic (QL)---developed later in this book---there are wffs which are not sentences.)

The recursive structure of sentences in SL will be important when we consider the circumstances under which a particular sentence would be true or false. The sentence $\enot \enot \enot D$ is true if and only if the sentence $\enot \enot D$ is false, and so on through the structure of the sentence until we arrive at the atomic components: $\enot \enot \enot D$ is true if and only if the atomic sentence $D$ is false. We will return to this point in much more detail in Chapters \ref{ch.TruthTables} and \ref{ch.SLmodels}.



\subsection{Notational conventions}
\label{SLconventions}
A wff like $(Q \eand R)$ must be surrounded by parentheses, because we might apply the definition again to use this as part of a more complicated sentence. If we negate $(Q \eand R)$, we get $\enot(Q \eand R)$. If we just had $Q \eand R$ without the parentheses and put a negation in front of it, we would have $\enot Q \eand R$. It is most natural to read this as meaning the same thing as $(\enot Q \eand R)$, something very different than $\enot(Q\eand R)$. The sentence $\enot(Q \eand R)$ means that it is not the case that both $Q$ and $R$ are true; $Q$ might be false or $R$ might be false, but the sentence does not tell us which. The sentence $(\enot Q \eand R)$ means specifically that $Q$ is false and that $R$ is true. So parentheses are crucial to the meaning of the sentence.

Consequently, strictly speaking, $Q \eand R$ without parentheses is \emph{not} a sentence of SL. When using SL, however, we will sometimes be able to relax the precise definition so as to make things easier for ourselves. We will do this in several ways.

First,  we understand that $Q \eand R$ means the same thing as $(Q \eand R)$. As a matter of convention, we can leave off parentheses that occur \emph{around the entire sentence}. Think of this as a kind of shorthand; we don't always write out the parentheses that we know are really there.

Second, it can sometimes be confusing to look at long sentences with nested sets of parentheses. We adopt the convention of using square brackets `[' and `]' in place of parenthesis. There is no logical difference between $(P\eor Q)$ and $[P\eor Q]$, for example. The unwieldy sentence
$$(((H \eif I) \eor (I \eif H)) \eand (J \eor K))$$
could be written in this way, omitting the outer parentheses and using square brackets to make the inner structure easier to see:
$$\bigl[(H \eif I) \eor (I \eif H)\bigr] \eand (J \eor K)$$
{\color{black} (Unfortunately, the online \textit{Carnap} system will NOT ALLOW you to use square brackets when working in system LogicBookSD. For this, I am sorry! Carnap will also always add the outer parentheses which really can make things a bit harder to parse\dots.)} 
% Life is a series of disappointment, so get used to it!

Third, we will sometimes want to translate the conjunction of three or more sentences. For the sentence `Alice, Bob, and Candice all went to the party', suppose we let $A$ mean `Alice went', $B$ mean `Bob went', and $C$ mean `Candice went.' The definition only allows us to form a conjunction out of two sentences, so we can translate it as $(A \eand B) \eand C$ or as $A \eand (B \eand C)$. There is no reason to distinguish between these, since the two translations are logically equivalent. There is no logical difference between the first, in which $(A \eand B)$ is conjoined with $C$, and the second, in which $A$ is conjoined with $(B \eand C)$.  So we might as well just write $A \eand B \eand C$. As a matter of convention, we can leave out parentheses when we conjoin three or more sentences.

Fourth, a similar situation arises with multiple disjunctions. `Either Alice, Bob, or Candice went to the party' can be translated as $(A \eor B) \eor C$ or as $A \eor (B \eor C)$. Since these two translations are logically equivalent, we may write $A \eor B \eor C$.

These latter two conventions only apply to multiple conjunctions or multiple  disjunctions. If a series of connectives includes both disjunctions and conjunctions, then the parentheses are essential; as with $(A \eand B) \eor C$ and $A \eand (B \eor C)$. The parentheses are also required if there is a series of conditionals or biconditionals, as with $(A \eif B) \eif C$ and $A \eiff (B \eiff C)$.

We have adopted these four rules as \emph{notational conventions}, not as changes to the definition of a sentence. Strictly speaking, $A \eor B \eor C$ is still not a sentence. Instead, it is a kind of shorthand. We write it for the sake of convenience, but we really mean the sentence $(A \eor (B \eor C))$.

Unless and until you are very confident about wffs and the use of parentheses, it is probably good advice to stick to the formal rules. These notational conventions are a way to skip steps when writing things down; if you're unsure about whether it's OK to take the shortcut, the safest thing is to go by the formal definition.

If we had given a different definition for a wff, then these could count as wffs. We might have written rule 2 in this way: ``If \metaA{}, \metaB{}, $\ldots$ \script{Z} are wffs, then $(\metaA{}\eand\metaB{}\eand\ldots\eand\script{Z})$, is a wff.'' This would make it easier to translate some English sentences, but would have the cost of making our formal language more complicated. We would have to keep the complex definition in mind when we develop truth tables and a proof system. We want a logical language that is \emph{expressively simple} and allows us to translate easily from English, but we also want a \emph{formally simple} language. (As we'll see later, this is important if we want to be able to prove things \emph{about} our language.) Adopting notational conventions is a compromise between these two desires.


\section{Use vs. mention}\label{s:UseMention}
We have just talked a lot \emph{about} sentences. So we should pause to explain an important, and very general, point.\footnote{Adapted from \S II.8 of Calgary remix} {\color{black}This section rehashes some distinctions introduced above---such as object vs. metalanguage---but in a new light, aided by yet another distinction! I'll say that the use--mention distinction in Section~\ref{sec:quotation} really matters conceptually, and the rest matters but maybe not so much right now, on a first pass.} 
% But we caution: Sometimes the new lights aren't more illuminating. It's also not true that where the waters are dark the lake must be deep. Sometimes the lake is pretty shallow but you just have a bad light. 

\subsection{Quotation conventions}
\label{sec:quotation}
Consider these two sentences:
	\begin{ebullet}
		\item Justin Trudeau is the Prime Minister.
		\item The expression `Justin Trudeau' is composed of two uppercase letters and eleven lowercase letters
	\end{ebullet}
When we want to talk about the Prime Minister, we \emph{use} his name. When we want to talk about the Prime Minister's name, we \emph{mention} that name, which we do by putting it in quotation marks. Similarly, I might say that you are reading a logic textbook, whereas `Logic' is the name of a 21st century American rapper. 

There is a general point here. When we want to talk about things in the world, we just \emph{use} words. When we want to talk about words, we typically have to \emph{mention} those words. We need to indicate that we are mentioning them, rather than using them. To do this, some convention is needed. We can put them in quotation marks, display them centrally on the page, or come up with some other convention, such as corner quotes. 

Consider the following sentence: `Justin Trudeau' is the Prime Minister. That sentence says that some \emph{expression} is the Prime Minister. Clearly, that's false: Canadian parliamentarians are too clever to appoint an expression as prime minister (let's hope things stay that way!). The \emph{man} is the Prime Minister; his \emph{name} isn't. Conversely, this sentence:
	\begin{ebullet}
		\item Justin Trudeau is composed of two uppercase letters and eleven lowercase letters.
	\end{ebullet}
also says something false: Justin Trudeau is a man, composed mainly of a few chemical elements rather than letters. One final example:
	\begin{ebullet}
		\item ``\,`Justin Trudeau'\,'' is the name of `Justin Trudeau'.
	\end{ebullet} 
On the left-hand-side, here, we have the name of a name. On the right hand side, we have a name. Perhaps this kind of sentence only occurs in logic textbooks, but it is true nonetheless.

Those are just general rules for quotation, and you should observe them carefully in all your work! To be clear, the quotation-marks here do not indicate reported speech. They indicate that you are moving from talking about an object, to talking about a name of that object. {\color{black} To be fair, it is often difficult to religiously follow the distinction between use and mention. Indeed, in the preceding sections, we have mentioned a lot of symbols but often not put them in the quotation marks they deserve! The following subsections provide some creative justifications for our bad behavior!}

{\color{black} Maybe one last example to make things vivid: we sit in chairs. We do not sit in `chairs'. `Chairs' is a name for the things we sit in, namely chairs. If you are ever going to try to sit on a `chair', just remember that `chair' is made up mostly of `air', and it has no legs to support you.}


\subsection{Object language and metalanguage}
These general quotation conventions are very important for us. After all, we are describing a formal language here, SL, and so we must often \emph{mention} expressions from SL.

When we talk about a language, the language that we are talking about is called the \define{object language}. The language that we use to talk about the object language is called the \define{metalanguage}.

\iffalse  %would need to add these glossary commands to UBC version 
\label{def.metalanguage}
\newglossaryentry{object language}
{
name=object language,
description={A language that is constructed and studied by logicians. In this textbook,
 the object languages are SL and QL}
}

\newglossaryentry{metalanguage}
{
name=metalanguage,
description={The language logicians use to talk about the object language. In this textbook, the metalanguage is English, supplemented by certain symbols like metavariables and technical terms like ``valid''}
}
\fi 

For the most part, the object language in this chapter has been the formal language that we have been developing: SL. The metalanguage is English. Not conversational English exactly, but English supplemented with some additional vocabulary to help us get along.

Now, we have used uppercase letters as sentence letters of SL:
	$$A, B, C, Z, A_1, B_4, A_{25}, J_{375},\ldots$$
These are sentences of the object language (SL). They are not sentences of English. So we must not say, for example:
	\begin{ebullet}
		\item $D$ is a sentence letter of SL.
	\end{ebullet}
Obviously, we are trying to come out with an English sentence that says something about the object language (SL), but `$D$' is a sentence of SL, and not part of English. So the preceding is gibberish, just like:
	\begin{ebullet}
		\item Schnee ist wei\ss\ is a German sentence.
	\end{ebullet}
What we surely meant to say, in this case, is:
	\begin{ebullet}
		\item `Schnee ist wei\ss' is a German sentence.
	\end{ebullet}
Equally, what we meant to say above is just:
	\begin{ebullet}
		\item `$D$' is a sentence letter of SL.
	\end{ebullet}
The general point is that, whenever we want to talk in English about some specific expression of SL, we need to indicate that we are \emph{mentioning} the expression, rather than \emph{using} it. We can either deploy quotation marks, or we can adopt some similar convention, such as  placing it centrally in the page.


\subsection{Metavariables}\label{s:Metavariables}
However, we do not just want to talk about \emph{specific} expressions of SL. We also want to be able to talk about \emph{any arbitrary} sentence of SL. Indeed, we had to do this in \S\ref{sec:wff}, when we presented the recursive definition of a sentence of SL. We used uppercase script letters to do this, namely:
	$$\metaA{}, \metaB{}, \metaC{}, \ldots$$
These symbols do not belong to SL. Rather, they are part of our (augmented) metalanguage that we use to talk about \emph{any} expression of SL. To explain why we need them, recall the second clause of the recursive definition of a sentence of SL:
	\begin{earg}
		\item[2.] If $\metaA{}$ is a sentence, then $\enot \metaA{}$ is a sentence.
	\end{earg}
This talks about \emph{arbitrary} sentences. If we had instead offered:
	\begin{ebullet}
		\item If `$P$' is a sentence, then `$\enot P$' is a sentence.
	\end{ebullet}
this would not have allowed us to determine whether `$\enot B$' is a sentence. To emphasize:
	\factoidbox{
	  `$\metaA{}$' is a symbol (called a \define{metavariable}) in augmented English, which we use to talk about expressions of SL. 	`$P$' is a particular sentence letter of SL.}

\iffalse
        \newglossaryentry{metavariables}
{
name=metavariables,
description={A variable in the metalanguage that can represent any sentence in the object language}
}
\fi

But this last example raises a further complication, concerning quotation conventions. We did not include any quotation marks in the second clause of our recursive definition. Should we have done so?

The problem is that the expression on the right-hand-side of this rule, i.e., `$\enot\metaA{}$', is not a sentence of English, since it contains `$\enot$'. So we might try to write:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[2$'$.] If \metaA{} is a sentence, then `$\enot \metaA{}$' is a sentence.
	\end{enumerate}
But this is no good: `$\enot \metaA{}$' is not a SL sentence, since `$\metaA{}$' is a symbol of (augmented) English rather than a symbol of SL.

What we really want to say is something like this:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[2$''$.] If \metaA{} is a sentence, then the result of concatenating the symbol `$\enot$' with the sentence \metaA{} is a sentence.
	\end{enumerate}
This is impeccable, but rather long-winded. %Quine introduced a convention that speeds things up here. In place of (2$''$), he suggested:
%	\begin{enumerate}
%		\item[2$'''$.] If \metaA{} and \metaB{} are sentences, then $\ulcorner (\metaA{}\eand\metaB{})\urcorner$ is a sentence
%	\end{enumerate}
%The rectangular quote-marks are sometimes called `Quine quotes', after Quine. The general interpretation of an expression like `$\ulcorner (\metaA{}\eand\metaB{})\urcorner$' is in terms of rules for concatenation.
But we can avoid long-windedness by creating our own conventions {\color{black} (as you're probably starting to see, logicians are very good at getting out of trouble by inventing new conventions!)\footnote{{\color{black} You might even start to wonder: is logic ultimately a set of conventions? What about mathematics? Daring questions, but philosophical ones!}}. We can perfectly well stipulate that an expression like `$\enot \metaA{}$' should simply be read \emph{directly} in terms of rules for concatenation. So, \emph{officially}, the metalanguage expression `$\enot \metaA{}$'
simply abbreviates:
\begin{quote}
	the result of concatenating the symbol `$\enot$' with the sentence \metaA{}
\end{quote}
and similarly, for expressions like `$(\metaA{} \eand \metaB{})$', `$(\metaA{} \eor \metaB{})$', etc.


\subsection{Quotation conventions for arguments}
One of our main purposes for using SL is to study arguments, and that will be our concern in chapter \ref{ch.TruthTables}. In English, the premises of an argument are often expressed by individual sentences, and the conclusion by a further sentence. Since we can symbolize English sentences, we can symbolise English arguments using SL.

Or rather, we can use SL to symbolize each of the \emph{sentences} used in an English argument. However, SL itself has no way to flag some of them as the \emph{premises} and another as the \emph{conclusion} of an argument.  (Contrast this with natural English, which uses words like `so', `therefore', etc., to mark that a sentence is the \emph{conclusion} of an argument.)

%So, if we want to symbolize an \emph{argument} in SL, what are we to do? 

%An obvious thought would be to add a new symbol to the \emph{object} language of SL itself, which we could use to separate the premises from the conclusion of an argument. However, adding a new symbol to our object language would add significant complexity to that language, since that symbol would require an official syntax.\footnote{\emph{The following footnote should be read only after you have finished the entire book!} And it would require a semantics. Here, there are deep barriers concerning the semantics. First: an object-language symbol which adequately expressed `therefore' for SL would not be truth-functional. (\emph{Exercise}: why?) Second: a paradox known as `validity Curry' shows that FOL itself \emph{cannot} be augmented with an adequate, object-language `therefore'.} 

So, we need another bit of notation. Suppose we want to symbolize the premises of an argument with $\metaA{}_1$, \dots,~$\metaA{}_n$ and the conclusion with $\metaC{}$. Then we will write:
$$\metaA{}_1, \ldots, \metaA{}_n \; \therefore \; \metaC{}$$
The role of the symbol `$\therefore$' is simply to indicate which sentences are the premises and which is the conclusion.

%Strictly, this extra notation is \emph{unnecessary}. After all, we could always just write things down long-hand, saying: the premises of the argument are well symbolised by $\metaA{}_1, \ldots \metaA{}_n$, and the conclusion of the argument is well symbolised by $\metaC{}$. But having some convention will save us some time. Equally, the particular convention we chose was fairly \emph{arbitrary}. After all, an equally good convention would have been to underline the conclusion of the argument. Still, this is the convention we will use.

Strictly, the symbol `$\therefore$' will not be a part of the object language, but of the \emph{metalanguage}. As such, one might think that we would need to put quote-marks around the SL-sentences which flank it. That is a sensible thought, but adding these quote-marks would make things harder to read. Moreover---and as above---recall that \emph{we} are stipulating some new conventions. So, we can simply stipulate that these quote-marks are unnecessary. That is, we can simply write:
$$A, A \eif B \; \therefore \; B$$
\emph{without any quotation marks}, to indicate an argument whose premises are (symbolized by) `$A$' and `$A \eif B$' and whose conclusion is (symbolized by) `$B$'.
