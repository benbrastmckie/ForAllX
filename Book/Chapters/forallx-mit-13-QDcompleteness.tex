  \label{sub:Extensions}

Assume $\Gamma$ is a consistent set of QL$^=$ sentences where we will maintain this assumption throughout the proof in order to show that $\Gamma$ is satisfiable.
It follows that there is no QL$^=$ sentence $\metaA$ where $\Gamma\proves \metaA\wedge\neg \metaA$.
This section will construct a superset $\Delta\supseteq\Gamma$ which may be shown to be saturated, maximal, and consistent.
  % TODO: change definition of consistency
We will begin by adding a range of new constants to $QL^=$ which will serve as witnesses for the quantified sentences in $\Gamma$. 





\subsection{Witnesses}%
  \label{sub:Witnesses}
  

Let QL$^=_{\N}$ be a language like QL$^=$ except for including the natural numbers $\N$ as an additional set of constants.
Even though $\Gamma$ is consistent in QL$^=$, it does not immediately follow that $\Gamma$ is consistent in QL$^=_{\N}$.
In general, adding expressive resources to a language can provide the grounds for new derivations and so we need to check that a contradiction cannot be derived in QL$^=_{\N}$.
In order to rule this possibility out, we will begin with the following lemma:

\begin{Lthm} \label{lemma:gencon}
  If $\Gamma\proves\metaA$ and $\beta$ is a constant that does not occur in any $\metaB\in\Gamma$, then there is a variable $\alpha$ which does not occur in $\metaA$ such that $\Gamma\proves \qt{\forall}{\alpha}\metaC$ where $\metaC=\metaA\unisub{\alpha}{\beta}$ and the derivation of $\qt{\forall}{\alpha}\metaC$ from $\Gamma$ does not include $\beta$.
\end{Lthm}

\begin{quote} 
  \textit{Proof:} Assume $\Gamma\proves\metaA$ where $\beta$ is a constant that does not occur in any $\metaB\in\Gamma$.
\end{quote}





\begin{Lthm} \label{lemma:const}
  If $\Gamma$ is a consistent in QL$^=$, then $\Gamma$ is also a consistent in QL$^=_{\N}$.
\end{Lthm}

\begin{quote} 
  \textit{Proof:} Assume $\Gamma$ is a consistent set of QL$^=$ sentences.
\end{quote}

Although the proof follows easily given \textbf{\ref{lemma:gencon}}, the proof is not immediate.
Nevertheless, it is hardly surprising that merely adding new constants would enable the derivation of a contradiction from $\Gamma$ when no contradiction is derivable from $\Gamma$ without those additional constants.
Given $\Gamma$ is consistent in QL$^=$, we may conclude that $\Gamma$ is consistent in QL$^=_{\N}$.





\subsection{Saturation}%
  \label{sub:Saturation}

We will now move to extend $\Gamma$ to a saturated set of sentences, where a set of sentences $\Sigma$ is \define{saturated} just in case $\metaA\unisub{\beta}{\alpha}\in\Sigma$ for some constant $\beta$ whenever $\qt{\exists}{\alpha}\metaA\in\Sigma$.
Consider the fixed enumeration of existentially qu

Letting $\set{\metaA_i:\qt{\exists}{\alpha}\metaA_i}$
\begin{align*}
  \label{name}
  \Sigma_0     &= \Gamma\\
  \Sigma_{n+1} &= \Sigma_n\cup\set{\metaA_{n+1}\unisub{n+1}{\alpha}}
\end{align*}

Following are possible modifications to our QL tree system. For each, imagine a system that is like the system laid out in this chapter, except for the indicated change. Would the modified tree system be sound? If so, explain how the proof given in this chapter would extend to a system with this rule; if not, give a tree that is a counterexample to the soundness of the modified system.
