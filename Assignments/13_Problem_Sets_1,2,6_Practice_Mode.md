## Symbolization 

<br />

Using the symbolization key given, symbolize the following sentences
in SL. There are 15 questions in total. Those worth 1 point have an autocheck feature so you can verify if you did it correctly before submitting. You type your answer in the text box above `Submit`. (The box below `Submit` stays fixed to show you what you're trying to symbolize). 

* $S$: Siobhan is a logician.
* $R$: Thi is a logician. 
* $P$: Thi is a philosopher.
* $M$: Thi is a musician.
* $L$: Leslie likes Siobhan.

~~~{.Translate .Prop system="LogicBookSD" submission="none"}
PS1.1 P \/ M : Thi is either a philosopher or a musician.
~~~
~~~{.Translate .Prop system="LogicBookSD" submission="none"}
PS1.2 P /\ ~M : Thi is a philosopher, but not a musician.
~~~

[Again, with just exam option, you still get a dialogue box pop up if you try to submit an incorrect result! But adding in nocheck does work! Eliminates green box entirely!]::

~~~{.Translate .Prop system="LogicBookSD" submission="none"}
PS1.3 ~S -> R : Thi is a logician if Siobhan isn't.
~~~
~~~{.Translate .Prop system="LogicBookSD" submission="none"}
PS1.4 S -> L : Siobhan is a logician only if Leslie likes her.
~~~

* $S$: Siobhan is a logician.
* $C$: Siobhan is Canadian.
* $R$: Thi is a logician. 
* $P$: Thi is a philosopher.
* $M$: Thi is a musician.
* $L$: Leslie likes Siobhan.

~~~{.Translate .Prop system="LogicBookSD" submission="none"}
PS1.5 L /\ S : Leslie likes Siobhan even though she is a logician.
~~~
~~~{.Translate .Prop system="LogicBookSD" submission="none"}
PS1.6 (S /\ C) \/ L : Siobhan is a Canadian logician unless Leslie likes her.
~~~
~~~{.Translate .Prop system="LogicBookSD" submission="none"}
PS1.7 ~R /\ ~S : Neither Thi nor Siobhan is a logician.
~~~
~~~{.Translate .Prop system="LogicBookSD" submission="none"}
PS1.8 (P /\ M) -> ~(C /\ S) : Thi is both a philosopher and a musician only if Siobhan isn't a Canadian logician.
~~~

* $S$: Siobhan is a logician.
* $C$: Siobhan is Canadian.
* $R$: Thi is a logician. 
* $P$: Thi is a philosopher.
* $M$: Thi is a musician.
* $L$: Leslie likes Siobhan.

~~~{.Translate .Prop system="LogicBookSD" submission="none"}
PS1.9 (S /\ L) -> (R \/ M) : If Siobhan is a logician whom Leslie likes, Thi is a logician, too, or a musician. 
~~~
~~~{.Translate .Prop system="LogicBookSD" submission="none"}
PS1.10 ~R /\ (~P /\ ~M) : Thi is neither a logician, nor a philosopher, nor a musician.
~~~
~~~{.Translate .Prop system="LogicBookSD" submission="none"}
PS1.11 L \/ (S <-> ~R)  : Unless Leslie likes her, Siobhan is a logician if and only if Thi isn't.
~~~
~~~{.Translate .Prop system="LogicBookSD" submission="none"}
PS1.12 (S /\ R) -> ((P \/ M) /\ ~(P /\ M)) : Thi is a philosopher or musician but not both, provided he and Siobhan are both logicians.
~~~

* $S$: Siobhan is a logician.
* $R$: Thi is a logician. 
* $P$: Thi is a philosopher.
* $M$: Thi is a musician.

For the next problem you have to find a sentence of SL that is true if, and
only if, exactly one of Thi and Shioban is a logician.

~~~{.Translate .Prop system="LogicBookSD" submission="none"}
PS1.13 ~(S <-> R) : Exactly one of Thi and Shioban is a logician.
~~~

[alternate solution for `exactly one' problem: (S & ~R) v (~S & R)]::

"Thi is not a logician or a philosopher" is ambiguous. One reading is
that either Thi isn't a logician, or Thi is a philosopher. Symbolize the
*other* reading.

~~~{.Translate .Prop system="LogicBookSD" submission="none"}
PS1.14 ~(R \/ P) : Thi is not a logician or a philosopher.
~~~

* $R$: Thi is a logician. 
* $P$: Thi is a philosopher.
* $M$: Thi is a musician.

The sentence "Thi is a musician or not a philosopher and a logician" is ambiguous.
One reading is that Thi is either a musician, or he is not a
philosopher but is a logician. Another is that Thi is a logician, and
also either a musician or not a philosopher. Symbolize the remaining third
reading. 

~~~{.Translate .Prop system="LogicBookSD" submission="none"}
PS1.15 M \/ ~(P /\ R) : Thi is a musician or not a philosopher and a logician.

$F \& (\sim G \supset H), \sim H \equiv F \; \therefore \; \sim F \lor
\sim (H \& F)$

###Getting Started with Natural Deduction


The following are a few simple natural deduction proofs. These questions are designed to get you used to natural deduction
and its rules, and how to format proofs in Carnap.



####Carnap Basics: 

In *Carnap*, you indicate that a line is a premise by writing `:PR` to
the right of the premise. (The ghost of Carnap has filled in the premise for you in the first problem below.) *Carnap* will render the proof nicely, off to
the right. For instance, it will draw a line under the last premise.
Now you will have to write the steps leading to the conclusion
underneath. 

- Nearly every line will have a sentence in it, and a justification
separated by a colon `:` to the right (the only exception is with adjacent subproofs used in rule `vE`---we'll get there!). 
- In the proof below, to justify line 2
by âˆ§E from line 1 you'd enter `:1 &E ` next to the sentence `A` being
justified. (Note: order matters here in the justification column. You MUST write line numbers first, then the derivation rule.) 
- In nice mode, a `+` will appear next to a line once you have entered a correct
justification for a legal line. If the justification is incorrect (or if your sentence is unjustifiable), you'll get a `?` or
a `âœ—`. *Carnap* will try to tell you what's wrong: hover the cursor over
the `?` or `âœ—` to see a hint. Sometimes these hints are a bit, well, cryptic (honestly they're often borderline useless). 

- Also really important: in your justification, you CANNOT put any symbols between the last line number and the rule you are citing. NO comma, or else poor Mr. Carnap gets confused. Spaces are fine (although no space necessary, e.g. `:2,3>E ` works!)

#### Problem 1

Give a formal proof of the following argument.

[](Following is from Zach PS3.6)

$A \& (B \& C) \therefore (C \& B) \& A$, i.e. from the assumption that $A \& (B \& C)$ is true, derive the conclusion $(C \& B) \& A$. (and think about why this is intuitively a valid inference!). 

~~~{.ProofChecker .LogicBookSD options="tabindent guides fonts resize render" submission="none"}
PS6.1 A & (B & C) :|-: (C & B) & A
|A & (B & C) :PR
~~~


From $\sim E \& A$, A $\supset$ $(B \& C)$, B $\supset$ D , derive $C \& (D \& \sim E)$ in our system SND. Remember to start your proof by typing each of the three premises on its own line, each followed by `:PR`:

[](Following is from Zach PS3.7)

~~~{.ProofChecker .LogicBookSD options="tabindent guides fonts resize render" submission="none"}
PS6.2 ~E /\ A, A -> (B /\ C), B -> D :|-: C /\ (D /\ ~E)
~~~


[](Following is from JTapp 303, PS4, number 1)

~~~{.ProofChecker .LogicBookSD options="tabindent guides fonts resize render" submission="none"} 
PS6.3 K > (~D & E), (A&K)&C :|-: ~D \/ B
~~~

Note Well: To justifiy Biconditional Intro or Elimination, you must type `<->I` or `<->E`  in the justification column. Typing with `<>` will NOT WORK!  This is a sad glitch in Carnap it seems! You can also copy/paste the $\equiv$ symbol. 

[](Following is from JTapp 303, PS4, number 2)

~~~{.ProofChecker .LogicBookSD options="tabindent guides fonts resize render" submission="none"} 
PS6.4 ~G <> F, D>~G, ~H&D :|-: F&~H
~~~

##Rules with Subproofs

For many subsequent problems, you will need to use the $\supset$I and/or $\lor$E
rules. These require subproofs. In *Carnap*, you indicate that a line is
part of a subproof by indenting it, i.e., adding one or more spaces to
the left of the sentence. 

- The assumption of a subproof is justified by writing 
  `:AS` to the right of the sentence (you can even tack on a little note to yourself if you want, e.g. `:AS for >I`, and this won't mess anything up! I write notes to myself all the time!)
- The **sentences within a subproof must line up exactly**. The easiest way to ensure proper alignment is to use the `tab` key. Use one `tab` for every layer of subproof. And look at the vertical scope lines in the rendering on the RIGHT of your proof; these scope lines show what *Carnap* thinks you've entered, even if YOU think you've entered SOMETHING ELSE. The goal is to impress *Carnap*, not yourself! (the customer is always right!) 

###Practicing Conditional Introduction 

- Give a formal proof of the following argument:

[](Following is from Zach PS3.8)

- $A \supset C, B \supset D \therefore (A \& B) \supset (C \& D)$

~~~{.ProofChecker .LogicBookSD options="tabindent guides fonts resize render" submission="none"} 
PS6.5 A -> C, B -> D :|-: (A /\ B) -> (C /\ D)
~~~

- Hint: use conditional intro to *build up* what you need! 

[](Following is from JTapp 303, PS4, number 3)

~~~{.ProofChecker .LogicBookSD options="tabindent guides fonts resize render" submission="none"} 
PS6.6 (B>B)>B :|-: B
~~~

### Practicing Disjunction Elimination 

In the next two problems you will need to use the $\lor$E rule, which requires
two subproofs. To separate two adjacent subproofs, enter a line with
only `--` at the right level of indentation. For instance, an
application of the $\lor$E rule would be entered like this:

~~~{.ProofChecker .LogicBookSD options="tabindent guides fonts resize render" init="now" submission="none"} 
Example P v P :|-: P & P
|P v P :PR
|  P :AS
|  P & P :2, 2 &I 
|--
|  P :AS
|  P & P :5, 5 &I 
|P & P :1, 2-3, 5-6 vE 
~~~

- In the example above, our subproofs are "one level deep", so we don't need to tab before entering `--`. 
- If your subproofs were two levels deep, then you would tab-in once for the `--`. 
- Notice the particularly complex justification structure for `vE`: you cite the line with the disjunction you're eliminating, then both subproofs. 

Give a formal proof of the following argument:

- $A \lor B, A \supset C, B \supset D \therefore C \lor D$

Remember to separate the two subproofs by `--`. This line should **not**
be indented (unless in a future problem you're using vE in the midst of a subproof!).

[](Following is from Zach, PS3.9)

~~~{.ProofChecker .LogicBookSD options="tabindent guides fonts resize render" submission="none"}
PS6.7 A \/ B, A -> C, B -> D :|-: C \/ D
~~~


Remember: To justifiy Biconditional Intro or Elimination, you must type `<->I` or `<->E`  in the justification column. Typing with `<>` will NOT WORK! You can also copy/paste the $\equiv$ symbol. 

[](Following is from JTapp 303, PS4, number 5)

~~~{.ProofChecker .LogicBookSD options="tabindent guides fonts resize render" submission="none"} 
PS6.8 ~F>~G, ~F \/ H, H<>~G :|-: ~G
~~~

##Negation Intro and Elimination:

- Rules `~I` and `~E` also involve starting subproofs. These are two of the most powerful rules, and when you're totally stuck, it's worth giving one of them a try. 

- To use rules `~I` and `~E`, you need an instance of a sentence and its negation both WITHIN the subproof, i.e. under your starting assumption that begins the subproof. 
- So if you're using an earlier sentence as one of the contradiction-sentences, you'll HAVE to reiterate it under your subproof assumption, using rule `R`. 

The following problem illustrates how you can derive ANYTHING from a contradiction (much like in dreams). If only someone could hook me up with a contradiction...

~~~{.ProofChecker .LogicBookSD options="tabindent guides fonts resize render" submission="none"} 
PS6.9 I &~I :|-: H&(~A \/ B)
~~~

For the next one, I recommend using two nested subproofs! Or as they say at SoulCycle: grab a towel, take a sip of water, and GET YOUR LIFE TOGETHER!

~~~{.ProofChecker .LogicBookSD options="tabindent guides fonts resize render" submission="none"} 
PS6.10 ((A \/ R) > ~B) > B :|-: (~~B) \/ W
~~~



###Theorem proving (it's either going to be fun or not)

In these last two exercises we prove *theorems* (i.e. tautologies). You need to find a
proof which has no premises and the sentence $((A \lor (B \supset C) \&
B) \supset (C \lor (A \& A))$ as the last line. 

- You'll have to indent your first line and justify it as an assumption `:AS`, since we don't have any premises to start with. 
- Ultimately, you'll need to separate two adjacent subproofs again by `--`, but this time it must be indented to the level of the surrounding subproof.

~~~{.ProofChecker .LogicBookSD options="tabindent guides fonts resize render" submission="none"}
PS6.11  :|-: ((A \/ (B -> C)) /\ B) -> (C \/ (A /\ A))
~~~


Derive the law of excluded middle in our natural deduction system: 

- Remember to indent the first line or Carnap will be grumpy: 
- Remember that to use rules `~I` and `~E`, you need an instance of a sentence and its negation both within the subproof, i.e. under your starting assumption that begins the subproof. So if you're using an earlier sentence, you'll HAVE to reiterate it under your subproof assumption, using rule `R`.
