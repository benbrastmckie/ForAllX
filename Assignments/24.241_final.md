#### Phil 24.241 Logic I, Fall 2022 
# Final (Online Portion):
### QL translation, QL Models, Natural Deduction in QND!


<br />

<!---
This is the Final (online portion) for MIT Fall 2022 Logic I, 24.241.
Most of the problems are original to JH. First two natural deductions come from Tappenden 2019 Winter Final exam or practice. 

Note that the question 1.4 about ``Little Johnny's Healing power" has multiple readings and hence should never be used again!

Note that this version has some additional options for 1.4

Note to Josh: in the `draft_final' file I have more notes to self scattered throughout the doc (e.g. origins of problems, and solutions, and some easier analogue problems for future classes). I deleted this stuff here just in case there's some compiler issue and it showed up in a browser by accident. 

Description for students: Online portion of your Final exam! Due by end of exam period Monday 12/19, 4:30pm Eastern. 

Comments to self can be entered with [blah blah]:: or [](blah blah). Former needs an empty space before the line! 

-->

- Click the `Submit` button (only) when you are happy with your answer.
- YOU CAN ONLY SUBMIT ONCE! So be careful! *Carnap* will then acknowledge and record your submission. 

- There are 13 questions,  for a total of 100 "points" (scaled to half the exam, i.e. 13.5 grade points). 

**You must ultimately click the `Submit` button for each problem!**

To enter logical symbols on the keyboard, use the following or copy/paste:

------------------------- -----------------------------
not ~                     `-`, `~`
and &                       `&`, `/\`
or $\lor$                       `v`, `\/`
if then $\supset$                  `>`, `->`
if and only if ≡           `<>`, `<->`
universal quantifier ∀    `A`
existential quantifier ∃  `E` 
identity =                `=`
x not identical to y                `~x=y`
------------------------- -----------------------------

<br />

###Part 1: Symbolization (Translation) into QL 

- Symbolize the following sentences using the key below, repeated later for convenience. 

- There are 6 symbolization questions. Type your answer in the text box above `Submit`. (The box below `Submit` remains invariant, displaying the sentence to symbolize). 

**Domain of Discourse**: people (past and present)

------------- ----------------------- ------------- --------
**$Sx$**:         $x$ is a scholar       **$u$**:           Yourself (`**u**rself')
**$Axy$**:       $x$ accepts $y$      **$j$**:             Little Johnny 
**$Pxy$**:       $x$ has the power to heal $y$         
------------- ----------------------- ------------- --------

<br />


~~~{.Translate .FOL system="LogicBookPDE" options="exam nocheck" points=6}
F1.1 (Ax)Pxx & (Auu v ~(Ex)Pxu) : Everything has the power to heal itself, but nothing will have the power to heal you unless you accept yourself. 
~~~

~~~{.Translate .FOL system="LogicBookPDE" options="exam nocheck" points=6}
F1.2 (Ax)(Pxu > x=u) & Puu, (Ax)(Pxu <-> x=u), (Ax)(Ay)( (Pxu & Pyu) > x=y ) & Puu : Only you have the power to heal yourself (i.e. more eloquently, ``only what is truly oneself has the power to heal")
~~~


~~~{.Translate .FOL system="LogicBookPDE" options="exam nocheck" points=8}
F1.3 (Ex)(Ey)(~x=y & Sx & Sy & (Az)(Sz > (z=x v z=y) ) & ~Axy & ~Ayx & Pxx & Pyy ), (Ex)(Ey)(~x=y & Sx & Sy & ~Axy & ~Ayx & Pxx & Pyy ) & ~(Ex)(Ey)(Ez)(~x=y & ~x=z & ~y=z & Sx & Sy & Sz): Neither scholar accepts the other, but fortunately each can heal themself.  
~~~

------------- ----------------------- ------------- --------
**$Sx$**:         $x$ is a scholar       **$u$**:           Yourself (`**u**rself')
**$Axy$**:       $x$ accepts $y$      **$j$**:             Little Johnny 
**$Pxy$**:       $x$ has the power to heal $y$         
------------- ----------------------- ------------- --------

- The next one has auto-checker, courtesy of Lil' Johnny:

~~~{.Translate .FOL system="LogicBookPDE" options="exam" points=6}
F1.4  (Ex)(Pxj & (Ay) (Pyj > x=y) & Axj & x=j ), (Ex)(Ay)( (Pyj <-> x=y) & Axj & x=j), (Ex)(Pxj & Axj & x= j & (Ay) (Pyj > y=j) ), (Ex)(Ay)( (Pyj <-> j=y) & Axj & x=j)  : Little Johnny's healing power accepts Johnny and IS Little Johnny.  
~~~

~~~{.Translate .FOL system="LogicBookPDE" options="exam nocheck" points=6}
F1.5 (Ax)( (Sx & Pxx) > (Ey) (~x=y &Sy & ~Ayx & Axy) )  : Every scholar who has the power to heal themself accepts a scholar who doesn't accept them. (where "them" refers to the earlier scholar, i.e. mentioned in "every scholar"). 
~~~

~~~{.Translate .FOL system="LogicBookPDE" options="exam nocheck" points=6}
F1.6  ~(Ex)(Ey)(Axu & Ayu & ~x=y & ~Axj & ~Ayj), (Ax)(~(Axu & ~Axj)) v (Ex)(Ay)(Axu & ~Axj & (~x=y > ~(Ayu & ~Ayj))): At most one person who accepts you doesn't accept Lil' Johnny.
~~~


```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice options="exam nocheck" points=4}
F1.7 Which of the following is NOT a sentence of QL with identity? 
| Auu
| B (i.e. an SL atomic)
| (Ax)Pxx
| *(∃x)(∀y)( (Sx & ~x=y & Sy & Axy) ⊃ x=z )
| (∃x)Sx & ( (Puj & Auu) ⊃ u=j)
```



###Part 2: Interpretations/Models in QL!

- For the next three problems, you have auto-checker enabled, but you can choose to submit incorrect work for partial credit. 

- Don't waste time here if you get stuck! Move on and come back! 

```{.CounterModeler .Simple system="LogicBookPD" options="exam" points=6}
F1.8 (Ex)~(Dx <-> Gx), (Ax)((Dx \/ Ex) -> Gx), (Ex)Dx
```


```{.CounterModeler .Simple system="LogicBookPD" options="exam" points=6}
F1.9 Caa, (Ax)(Cxa -> (Bx \/ ~Cax)), (Ex)(Cxa & ~Bx)
```


- Give an interpretation that shows that the following two
sentences are **NOT equivalent** in QL.

```{.CounterModeler .Simple counterexample-to="equivalence" system="LogicBookPD" options="exam" points=4}
F1.10 (Ex)(Gx > Fa), (Ex)Gx > Fa
```



###Part 3: Natural Deduction in QL 

- Assumptions for any subproofs must be justified by `:AS` or `:A/ ` 
- To justify a derived line, remember to write colon, line number(s), then rule. IN THAT ORDER! (e.g. `: 1, 2 >E`)
- I have initialized the proofs with the premises to aid your exam-addled brain! 

- Feedback is "syntax-only" (so no green checkmarks!)

~~~{.ProofChecker .LogicBookPD options="tabindent guides fonts resize render exam" init="now" feedback="syntaxonly" points=14} 
F1.11 (Ax)Px, (Ay) (Py > ~Qy), (Az) (~Qz > Rz) :|-: (Ax) Rx
|(Ax)Px :PR
|(Ay) (Py > ~Qy) :PR
|(Az) (~Qz > Rz) :PR
~~~

Remember to type `<->E` or `<->I` to justify a biconditional rule: 

~~~{.ProofChecker .LogicBookPD options="tabindent guides fonts resize render exam" init="now" feedback="syntaxonly" points=14} 
F1.12 (Ex) ~Qx, (Ax) (Qx <-> Px) :|-: (Ex) ~Px
|(Ex) ~Qx :PR
|(Ay) (Qy <-> Py) :PR
~~~

~~~{.ProofChecker .LogicBookPD options="tabindent guides fonts resize render exam" init="now" feedback="syntaxonly" points=14} 
F1.13 (Ex)(Fa > Gx) :|-:  Fa > (Ex)Gx
|(Ex)(Fa > Gx) :PR
~~~
