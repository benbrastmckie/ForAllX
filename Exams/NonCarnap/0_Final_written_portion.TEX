To ease Symbolization on \textit{Carnap}, below is the symbolization key for F1.1--F1.6: 
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
\item Domain of Discourse: people\\  (your peeps, my peeps, all the peeps)
\item $\mathbf{u}$: A name for yourself, i.e. `\textbf{u}rself' 
\item $\mathbf{j}$: Little \textbf{j}ohnny, our fictional hero  
\item $Sx$: $x$ is a \textbf{S}cholar 
\item $Axy$: $x$ \textbf{A}ccepts y
\item $Pxy$: $x$ has the \textbf{P}ower to heal $y$
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\medskip

\begin{enumerate}
%could put the rule on the back to give people scrap paper 
\item 
Consider a system $\mathit{SND}^*$ just like  $\mathit{SND}$ except that we add the rule ``negated disjunction intro.'' (\enot \eor I): $\{ \enot \metav{P}, \enot \metav{Q} \} \vdash \enot (\metav{P} \eor \metav{Q})$ (\textit{see back of page}). Does this rule preserve soundness? If so, extend our inductive proof by adding a case (showing that the new line is righteous); If not, provide a concrete counterexample to $\mathit{SND}^*$ soundness. [14pts] \\

For problems 2 and 3, let $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ be possibly infinite sets of QL-sentences:

\item If $\Gamma \cup \{ \enot \metav{P} \}$ is unsatisfiable and $\Delta \cup \{ \enot \metav{Q} \}$ is unsatisfiable, prove or provide a counterexample to the following: $\{ \Gamma \cup\Delta \} \vdash_{\mathit{QND}} (\metav{P} \eand \metav{Q})$. [10pts]

\item If $\Gamma \vdash_{\mathit{QND}} \metav{P}$ and $\Delta \cup\{\metav{H}\}$ is unsatisfiable, prove or provide a counterexample to the following: $\{ \Gamma \cup \Delta \} \vDash \big( (\metav{P} \eor \metav{R}) \eand \enot \metav{H} \big) $ [10pts] \\

%\item If $\Gamma \vdash_{\mathit{QND}} \metav{P}$ and $\Delta \cup\{\metav{H}\}$ is unsatisfiable, prove or provide a counterexample to the following: $(\Gamma \cup \Delta) \vDash (\metav{P} \eor \metav{R}) $ (note that I really do mean ``$\metav{H}$" and then ``$\metav{R}$.") [10pts] \\

\item Assume that $\Gamma^{\ast}$ is a maximally-SND-consistent set. Prove that the following membership condition holds: $\enot \metav{P} \eif \enot \metav{Q} \in \Gamma^{\ast}$ if and only if either $\metav{P}\in \Gamma^{\ast}$ or $\metav{Q}\notin \Gamma^{\ast}$. 

In your proof, you may use case (a) of our membership lemma (book's 6.4.11a) but no other cases! Note that you will need to provide two non-trivial schematic natural deductions (probably written on paper). [24pts] \\


\item Using the Soundness and Completeness theorems (or the Consistency Lemma) for system $\mathit{QND}$, prove that Quantifer Logic (without identity) is compact. [14pts] \\

\item Prove \textbf{ONE} of the following two claims [14 points]:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let $\Gamma$ be a set of QL-sentences. Prove that if $\Gamma$ is satisfiable, then $\Gamma$ is QND-consistent (i.e. syntactically consistent in derivation system QND). 

\item If $c$ does not occur in a QND-Consistent set $\Gamma_k \cup \{ \qt{\exists}{x} \metav{Q} \}$, then $\Gamma_k \cup \{\qt{\exists}{x} \metav{Q}, \metav{Q}\substitute{x}{c} \}$ is QND-consistent. \\ (NB: \textit{The Logic Book} mentions a lemma to prove this claim that is IRRELEVANT (Lemma 11.1.10). Instead, you must proceed purely syntactically.) \\

% (NB: \textit{The Logic Book} mentions a lemma to prove this claim that is insufficient without a proof of \#6a! And even then, it's not enough b/c at this point in the construction, we don't know that $\Gamma_k \cup \{ \qt{\exists}{x} \metav{Q} \}$ is quantificationally consistent, i.e. satisfiable. So do NOT appeal to Lemma 11.1.10 in your proof of \#6b. Here, you must proceed purely syntactically. 

%If \metav{c} does not occur in a QND-C set $\Gamma_k \cup \{ \qt{\exists}{\metav{x}} \metav{Q} \}$, then $\Gamma_k \cup \{\qt{\exists}{\metav{x}} \metav{Q}, \metav{Q}\substitute{\metav{x}}{\metav{c}} \}$ is QND-consistent
%you may assume that we have proven QND is sound. 
\end{enumerate}
%%Josh: add in a diagram and tell them they can use my line numbers. Or draw on the board during the exam! 

\item Briefly describe the significance of both (i) complete open branches and (ii) maximally-SND-consistent sets in the completeness proofs of STD and SND, respectively. \\ How are these ideas connected or similar? (i.e. what functional role(s) do they play in the completeness proofs of these derivation systems?)  [14pts]

%Imagine that we add the following rule, , to system SND. Add a case to our inductive proof of the Soundness of SND

%%idea: two mandatory problems, then two sets where they choose one!
