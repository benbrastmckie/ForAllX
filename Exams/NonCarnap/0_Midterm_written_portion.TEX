%\item Prove that in a sound tree system, no argument G is both a tree-tautology and a tree-contradiction. Let `G' be an arbitrary argument with finite premise set $\Gamma$ and conclusion $\Theta$. 

%(\textit{Hints}: Show that if an argument is tree-invalid, then it is not tree-valid. To do this, apply a key fact coming from our proof of completeness, and then apply the soundness result. Alternatively, you could do a proof by contradiction, using the same results.) 
% (but you'll still need soundness and the same key fact from our completeness proof. We stand here face to face with the hardness of the logical must). 

%\makebox[\textwidth]{\textbf{Solution}:}

%Suppose that argument G is tree-invalid. Then by definition, there exists at least one tree with root $\Gamma \cup\{\enot \Theta\} $ that has a complete open branch. Call this complete open branch `Oprah.' From our proof of completeness, we can use Oprah to define a truth value assignment that satisfies the root. This would be a TVA that makes the premises true but the conclusion false. Hence, the argument G must be semantically invalid, i.e. $\Gamma \nentails \Theta$. Since the system is Sound, we can apply the contrapositive of soundness to conclude that \textit{it is not the case that} G is tree-valid, i.e. $\Gamma \nvdash_{STD} \Theta$. 

%Hence, if an argument is tree-invalid, then it is not tree-valid (assuming our system is sound and complete). Hence, no argument is both tree-invalid and tree-valid.

%\makebox[\textwidth]{\textit{Alternative solution: proof by contradiction}:}

%Assume for contradiction that there is some argument G that is both tree-valid and tree-invalid. By soundness, G is semantically valid. Hence, whenever the premises $\Gamma$ are true, so is the conclusion $\Theta$. Hence, $\Gamma \cup\{\enot \Theta\} $ is inconsistent. 

%Yet, if G is tree-invalid, then there exists a tree with root $\Gamma \cup\{\enot \Theta\} $ that has a complete open branch. From our proof of completeness, we saw how to use such a branch to construct a TVA where the root is satisfied. So this TVA would satisfy $\Gamma \cup\{ \enot \Theta\} $. But that contradicts that $\Gamma \cup\{ \enot \Theta\} $ is unsatisfiable! Hence, G cannot also be tree-invalid.

\item Call a string over $\{b, e\}$ a ``4-beeb palindrome" if it is (i) a palindrome that has ``$beeb$" as the middle four letters and (ii) has a string-length that is divisible by four (so a 4-beeb palindrome can have $4, 8, 12, 16, \dots 4 \times n, \dots$ many letters) [$15+15 = 30$ points]
% You can assume the language has an empty string, or that it doesn't, but state which option you are going with, as the answer %will be slightly different in each case.\\

\textbf{(i) Give a recursive definition} of the set of ``4-beeb palindromes", labeling each of the relevant clauses. [$15$ points]

\textbf{(ii) prove by induction} that every 4-beeb palindrome has an even number of ``$b$"'s. Please state your \textbf{induction hypothesis} clearly! [$15$ points] \\

\item \textit{Using induction}, show that you cannot build a formula of propositional logic that is a contradiction using horseshoe (\eif) as your \textit{only} connective (i.e. every contradiction in SL contains at least one other connective besides horseshoe). [$20$ points] \\ 

-- Hint: call a formula ``\textbf{calm}'' if: (a) it is not a contradiction or (b) it
contains a ``\textit{stressed-connective}'' tilde (\enot), a vel (\eor), an ampersand $(\eand)$, or a biconditional (\eiff). For shorthand, you may call these four non-horseshoe connectives the ``stressed-connectives''. Show by induction that every formula of propositional logic is ``calm'', and explain how this establishes what is to be proven. \\

-- You may use our ``lazy induction schema'' for SL. \textit{Keep calm and logic on!} \\
