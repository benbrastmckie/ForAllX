\begin{itemize}
  % \item[$J$:] John believes the cookie is tasty.
  % \item[$M$:] Mary believes the cookie is tasty.
  % \item[$C$:] The cookie really is tasty.
  % \item[$A$:] Adrian is at the party.
  % \item[$B$:] Beth goes to the party.
  % \item[$C$:] Chuck goes to the party.
  % \item[$D$:] Adrian and Beth get into a debate.
  % \item[$E$:] Chuck entertains Beth.
  % \item[$H$:] The party is horrible.

\noindent
For the arguments given in \textbf{(P1)} and \textbf{(P2)}, complete the following tasks [5pt per task]:

\begin{itemize}
  \item[(I)] Use the symbolization key to regiment the argument in SL.
  \item[(II)] Use the tree method to check the validity of the SL argument.
    You do not need to label each step, but do not skip any steps, and mark branches as either complete and open or closed.
    Please give yourself lots of room so that your tree is easy to read.
  \item[(III)] If the argument is valid, provide an natural deduction proof in SD (you may use any of the derived rules provided on the last page but make sure to justify each line), and otherwise provide an interpretation that invalidates the argument.
  \item[(IV)] Does your regimentation of the argument in SL accurately capture the intuitive validity/invalidity of the argument in English? Answer with `YES' or `NO'.
  \item[(V)] If your answer to (IV) was `NO', what has been missed? 
    If `YES', does your answer to (III) succeed in explaining why the argument is valid/invalid?
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\begin{enumerate}
  % \item[\bf (P1)] John believes the cookie is tasty just in case the cookie really isn't tasty.
  %   Mary only believes the cookie is tasty if John does and the cookie really is tasty.
  %   So Mary doesn't believe the cookie is tasty.
  %   [20pt]
  % \item[\bf (P2)]  Adrian is at the party and knows that Beth is considering going. So long as Beth and Adrian don't get into a debate, the party won't be horrible, but it will be horrible if they do. However, if Beth goes to the party, she is sure to debate Adrian. But if Chuck goes to the party with Beth, then he will keep her entertained her, and so Beth and Adrian won't get into a debate. As a result, it's not true that the party will be horrible if Beth goes. [20pt]
  \item[\bf (P1)] If the fair coin had been flipped, it would have either landed heads or tails.
    But it's not true that if it had been flipped, it would have landed heads.
    Therefore if it had been flipped, it would have landed tails.
  \item[\bf (P2)] If either Dor or Eyal play, the party will be a success.
    Thus the party will be a success if Dor plays, and equally, the party will be a success if Eyal plays.

Recall the following lemmas from the proofs of soundness and completeness:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item[\tt Lemma 1:] Every satisfiable branch $\B$ in an SL tree $X$ is open. 
  \item[\tt Lemma 2:] If $X$ is an SL tree with a satisfiable branch $\B$, then any tree $X'$ which is the result of resolving a sentence in $\B$ has a satisfiable branch $\B'$.  
  \item[\tt Lemma 3:] Every SL tree with a satisfiable root has a satisfiable branch.
  \item[\tt Lemma 4:] Every SL tree $X$ has a finite number of branches.  
  \item[\tt Lemma 5:] For any SL tree $X$ with root $\Gamma$ and $\varphi\in[X]$, there is an SL tree $Y$ with root $\Gamma$ where $\res(Y)<\res(X)$. 
  \item[\tt Lemma 6:] For any tree $X$ with root $\Gamma$, there is a complete tree $X'$ with root $\Gamma$.

%\item Prove that in a sound tree system, no argument G is both a tree-tautology and a tree-contradiction. Let `G' be an arbitrary argument with finite premise set $\Gamma$ and conclusion $\Theta$. 

%(\textit{Hints}: Show that if an argument is tree-invalid, then it is not tree-valid. To do this, apply a key fact coming from our proof of completeness, and then apply the soundness result. Alternatively, you could do a proof by contradiction, using the same results.) 
% (but you'll still need soundness and the same key fact from our completeness proof. We stand here face to face with the hardness of the logical must). 

%\makebox[\textwidth]{\textbf{Solution}:}

%Suppose that argument G is tree-invalid. Then by definition, there exists at least one tree with root $\Gamma \cup\{\enot \Theta\} $ that has a complete open branch. Call this complete open branch `Oprah.' From our proof of completeness, we can use Oprah to define a truth value assignment that satisfies the root. This would be a TVA that makes the premises true but the conclusion false. Hence, the argument G must be semantically invalid, i.e. $\Gamma \nentails \Theta$. Since the system is Sound, we can apply the contrapositive of soundness to conclude that \textit{it is not the case that} G is tree-valid, i.e. $\Gamma \nvdash_{STD} \Theta$. 

%Hence, if an argument is tree-invalid, then it is not tree-valid (assuming our system is sound and complete). Hence, no argument is both tree-invalid and tree-valid.

%\makebox[\textwidth]{\textit{Alternative solution: proof by contradiction}:}

%Assume for contradiction that there is some argument G that is both tree-valid and tree-invalid. By soundness, G is semantically valid. Hence, whenever the premises $\Gamma$ are true, so is the conclusion $\Theta$. Hence, $\Gamma \cup\{\enot \Theta\} $ is inconsistent. 

%Yet, if G is tree-invalid, then there exists a tree with root $\Gamma \cup\{\enot \Theta\} $ that has a complete open branch. From our proof of completeness, we saw how to use such a branch to construct a TVA where the root is satisfied. So this TVA would satisfy $\Gamma \cup\{ \enot \Theta\} $. But that contradicts that $\Gamma \cup\{ \enot \Theta\} $ is unsatisfiable! Hence, G cannot also be tree-invalid.
