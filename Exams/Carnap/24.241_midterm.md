#### Phil 24.241 Logic I, Fall 2022 
# Midterm \#1 (Online Portion):
### SL translation, Truth Tables, Natural Deduction!

<br />

<!---
This is Midterm 1 (online portion) for MIT Fall 2022 Logic I, 24.241.
Many problems come from Tappenden UMichigan 303 Winter 2019 Midterm 1. 

Note to Josh: in the `draft_midterm' file I have more notes to self scattered throughout the doc (e.g. origins of problems, and solutions, and some easier analogue problems for future classes). I deleted this stuff here just in case there's some compiler issue and it showed up in a browser by accident. 

Description for students: Online portion of your Midterm exam! Due by end of class Wednesday 10/26, 10:55am Eastern. 

Comments to self can be entered with [blah blah]:: or [](blah blah). Former needs an empty space before the line! 

-->

When (and only when) you are happy with your answer, click the `Submit`
button. 
- YOU CAN ONLY SUBMIT ONCE! So be careful! *Carnap* will then acknowledge and record your submission. 

- There are 10 questions,  for a total of 100 "points" (which will scale to half of the overall midterm grade, i.e. 9 grade points). 

**You must ultimately click the `Submit` button for each exercise!**

To enter logical symbols on the keyboard, use:

------------------------- -----------------------------
not ~                     `-`, `~`
and &                     `/\`,  `&`
or âˆ¨                      `\/`, `v`
if then $\supset$                 `->`, `>`
if and only if $\equiv$          `<->`, `<>`
------------------------- -----------------------------

###Part 1: Symbolization (Translation) into SL 

Using the symbolization key given, symbolize the following sentences
in SL. There are 5 questions in total. Type your answer in the text box above `Submit`. (The box below `Submit` remains invariant, displaying the sentence to symbolize). 

* $F$: I have free will.
* $S$: I have a soul. 
* $B$: I (will still) **B**elieve I am free. 
* $K$: I **K**now that I am free.
* $A$: I fully and completely **A**ccept myself.
* $E$: I (will) recognize that I am **E**nough.

~~~{.Translate .Prop system="LogicBookSD" options="exam nocheck" points=6}
M1.1 F > (S & A) : I have Free will only if I both (i) have a Soul and (ii) fully and completely Accept myself. 
~~~

~~~{.Translate .Prop system="LogicBookSD" options="exam nocheck" points=4}
M1.2 B v ~K : Unless I Believe I am free, I don't Know that I am free.
~~~

~~~{.Translate .Prop system="LogicBookSD" options="exam nocheck" points=8}
M1.3 (A > E) & (~F > B) : I will recognize that I am Enough if I fully and completely Accept myself, but even if I don't have Free will, then I will still Believe I am free. 
~~~

~~~{.Translate .Prop system="LogicBookSD" options="exam nocheck" points=8}
M1.4 (K <-> (A & E)) v ~B: I Know that I am free just in case I (i) fully and completely Accept myself and (ii) recognize that I am Enough; unless I don't Believe that I am free. 
~~~

~~~{.Translate .Prop system="LogicBookSD" options="exam nocheck" points=8}
M1.5 A /\ (~S > ~B): Although I fully and completely Accept myself, I won't Believe that I am free provided that I don't have a Soul. 
~~~


```{.QualitativeProblem .MultipleChoice options="nocheck exam" points=4}
M1.6 Which of the sentences above could be broken down further into two separate atomic sentences? 
| Sentence F: I have free will
| *Sentence A: I fully and completely accept myself
| Sentence B: I believe I am free
| Sentence E: I recognize that I am enough
```





###Part 2: Truth Tables!

Determine if the following two sentences are equivalent
in Sentential Logic (SL) using a complete truth table. If they are INequivalent, then click `inequivalent` and enter a truth value assignment to the atomic sentence letters that shows this. 


~~~{.TruthTable .Simple counterexample-to="equivalence" system="LogicBookSD" options="autoAtoms nodash exam nocheck" points=12}
M1.7 (A v B) -> ~A,   ~(~A & ~B) > A
~~~


Determine if the following argument is valid in SL using a complete truth table or by constructing a counterexample to validity, i.e. by entering a truth value assignment (`T` or `F`) to the three atomic sentences CRW (in that order, no commas or spaces) on which the premises are all true but the conclusion is false. 

Note that the last sentence R$\equiv$W is the conclusion! The previous three sentences are the premises!



~~~{.TruthTable .Validity counterexample-to="validity" system="LogicBookSD" options="turnstilemark double-turnstile autoAtoms exam nocheck nodash" points=14}
M1.8  R v W, R > C, (C v R) > ~W :|-: R<>W
~~~



###Part 3: Natural Deduction in SL 

- Don't forget to copy each premise on the initial lines, justifying each with `:PR`. 
- Assumptions for any subproofs must be justified by `:AS`
- To justify a derived line, remember to write colon, line number(s), then rule. IN THAT ORDER! (e.g. `: 1, 2 >E`)




~~~{.ProofChecker .LogicBookSD options="tabindent guides fonts resize render exam" feedback="syntaxonly" points=18}
M1.9 R>C, A>~C :|-: A>~R
~~~



Remember to type `<->E` or `<->I` to justify a biconditional rule:

M1.10 Q<>R, Q v R :|-: Q&R
