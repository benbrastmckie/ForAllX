Following are possible modifications to our QL tree system. For each, imagine a system that is like the system laid out in this chapter, except for the indicated change. Would the modified tree system be sound? If so, explain how the proof given in this chapter would extend to a system with this rule; if not, give a tree that is a counterexample to the soundness of the modified system.

For each of the rule modifications given in Part \ref{pr.QLalttrees-sound}, would the modified tree system be complete? If so, explain how the proof given in this chapter would extend to a system with this rule; if not, give a tree that is a counterexample to the completeness of the modified system.
