\qOne{Is logic math?}
\aOne{We will use formal symbols as in mathematics, but this does not make logic a type of mathematics any more than it makes physics a type of mathematics. Logic has a subject mater all its own, though saying what this is will require some care.}

\qTwo{Is logic philosophy?}
\aTwo{There is a sub-discipline called \textit{Philosophical Logic} which may be viewed as a type of philosophy carried out with certain formal methods (proof theory and model theory). There is another sub-discipline called \textit{Mathematical Logic} which falls considerably closer to mathematics. We will be doing a bit of both.}

\qThree{Is logic a descriptive science?}
\aThree{No! Logic is a \textit{normative} science insofar as it aims to regiment how we ought to reason in an artificial language, not merely how we happen to reason in a natural language like English.}

\qFour{Why learn logic?}
\aFour{Logic seeks to describe an ideal for reasoning. Of course, we are all engaged in reasoning. Learning logic is something akin to upgrading your firmware. It will literally change how you think.}

\qFive{What does logic have to show for itself?}
\aFive{Logic played a critical role in putting mathematics on a solid foundation (ZFC is accepted by most working mathematicians) and gave birth to the modern theory of computation as well as modern linguistics.}

%	 OVERVIEW
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Overview}

During the first part of this course, we will study sentential logic (SL), also known as truth-functional (TFL) or propositional logic (PL). 
This is the logic of truth-functional connectives, including ‘not,’ ‘and,’ ‘or,’ ‘if-then,’ and ‘if and only if.’ 
But watch out: ‘if-then’ will not mean what you think it means! 

During the second part, we will study quantifer logic (QL), also known as first order logic (FOL). 
This is the logic of ‘for all’ and ‘some,’ plus our earlier sentential logic. 
In both parts, we will present a formal syntax along with a semantics to interpret the language.
Syntax will include the symbolization of natural language sentences into a formal language as well as proofs within that formal language. 
Semantics will include interpretations of the formal languages. 
For both parts of the course, we will do basic meta-logic, proving that our proof systems are sound and complete.

%	 GRADING SCHEME
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\vspace{0.5cm}
\section{Grading Scheme}

%below is the \twentyshort environment - a list with only two inputs. However, there is a \twenty environment, which creates a list with four inputs. You can find/alter details of that table in the .cls file c. lines 320. 
\begin{twentyshort}
	%\twentyitemshort{X\%}{Attendance/Participation}
  \twentyitemshort{55\%}{Problem Sets (11 assignments at \%5 each)}
	\twentyitemshort{20\%}{Midterm}
  \twentyitemshort{25\%}{Final Exam}
\end{twentyshort}

Grades will follow the standard scale: A = 89.5-100; B = 79.5-89.4; C = 69.5-79.4; D = 60-69.4; F  $<$60. Grades will not be curved.

\section{Problem Sets}

There will be 12 graded problem sets, due Fridays by 5pm.
Your lowest score will be dropped.
Many of these will be online using a program called ‘Carnap’ so that you can get real-time feedback as you work.
All work submitted MUST BE YOUR OWN, manifesting a direct causal relation to your own pen, pencil, or keyboard—written in your own voice without someone there with you or texting you answers.
As you will find, even logic leaves room for creativity, and it will be important to get a sense of that for yourself.
You are welcome to work through the problem set with at most two other students IN PREPARATION, but when it comes time to submit answers, you must be on your own.
If you choose to work with others, please indicate your teammates’ names at the top of each assignment.

\vspace{0.5cm}
\section{Carnap}

Most of the problem sets will be assigned on Carnap.
You will need to enrol \href{https://carnap.io/enroll/Logic%20I}{(link)} which you can find demonstrated \href{https://youtu.be/lmkWcxqxEZk}{here}.
Using Carnap will require some syntactic care: it is fussy about how things are entered, so you will have to learn to use the right syntax.
Please don't hesitate to get in touch if you run into any issues.

\section{Academic Integrity}

Blindly copying someone else’s solution (written or typed) is cheating.
In contrast, you are encouraged to talk through a solution step-by-step with a classmate or two where in doing so, everyone involved comes to understand each part.
However, when it comes time to write up and submit the solutions, it is important that you do this for yourself without consulting others throughout the process.

Learning logic requires practice! 
Compare learning to speak a natural language like English. %, or skills like learning to walk on two legs or ride a bike.
There are some tricks and techniques to get acquainted with where once you gain some familiarity, this course should be fun!
But getting comfortable using these techniques takes time, making this a very difficult course to cram for the night before an exam.
The good news is that with consistent practice, you should be able to master the techniques of this course long in advance of the exam.

Doing problem sets is the best way to practice throughout the course.
Cheating on problem sets will be to your own disadvantage in preparing for the exams.
If you cheat on an exam, the academic consequences will be severe, so please don't consider it.
There is more to life than grades; don't let them distract from learning!

Instead of worrying about your grade, I recommend that you just focus on mastering logic, doing your best work and feeling good about it.
Logic is an extremely deep subject, and foundational for this information age that we are all a part of.
This course should provide you with an important tool kit that I hope you enjoy learning to use and that will serve you well beyond the end of this course.
% This has certainly been true for me!

\section{Make-up Policy}

Make-up exams or problem-sets are only permitted for students in the midst of a medical or family emergency.
Making arrangements IN ADVANCE of the due date is required except in particularly difficult circumstances.

\vspace{0.5cm}
\section{Learning Objectives}

%use \begin{outline} or \begin{outline}[enumerate] to create a list with subitems. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Practice regimenting a range of natural language sentences into propositional and first-order languages.
  \item Learn how to assess complex natural language arguments for validity.
  \item Practice applying the rules of a proof system, regimenting valid reasoning.
  \item Develop an appreciation for meta-logical proofs about our proof systems and their corresponding semantics.
  \item Contemplate elements of the philosophy of logic, exploring such questions as: What is logic? What unites it as a discipline? What can logic do, and what are its limits? Do the rules of logic describe something universal or conventional?
\end{itemize}

\vspace{0.5cm}
\section{Diversity and Inclusivity Statement}

In all course-related activities and communications, you will be treated with respect.
I welcome individuals of all ages, backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, gender expressions, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, ability, and other visible and non-visible differences.
All members of this class are expected to help create a respectful, welcoming, and inclusive environment for every other member of the class.

\vspace{0.5cm}
\section{Accommodations for Students with Disabilities}

If you are a student with learning needs that require accommodation, please contact Disability and Access Services at \texttt{das-student@mit.edu} (or for assistive technology, \texttt{atic-staff@mit.edu}) as soon as possible, to make an appointment to discuss your needs and to obtain an accommodations letter.
Please also e-mail me as soon as possible to set up a time to discuss your learning needs.
As someone who has used these services in the past, you can assume that you will have my full support.
