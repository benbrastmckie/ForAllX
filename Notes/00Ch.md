# Notes for Chapter 0

- argument definition never given: sequence of declarative sentences
- deductive validity has been characterised as, "If the premises were true, the conclusion would be true as well" (p. 13)
  - But this is counterfactual and at at best a modal characterisation 
  - (p. 14) characterised as "No possible way for all three of its premises to be true without it snowing".
  - Official definition (O.4) "an argument is valid iff it is logically impossible for all the premises to be true while the conclusion is false"
- formal definitions departing from ordinary definitions
  - are they better? yes in that they are precise enough for mathematical treatment, but no in that they are very limited (two sides of the same coin)
  - why formalise?
- quotes: single for naming, double for scare
- logical form: sentences vs arguments
  - logical form explain validity when an argument is valid
- subject matter of the course
  - logical consequence i.e. semantic validity or deductive validity
  - provability i.e., syntactic consequence
