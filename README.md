# An Introduction to Formal Logic

This project is descendant of the open source logic textbook [ForAllX](https://www.fecundity.com/logic/) which has been heavily revised for teaching Logic I at MIT.
Whereas introductory courses in logic often draw students who are relatively new to mathematical reasoning, the undergraduate students taking logic at MIT tend to have strong formal backgrounds.
This textbook was rewritten on their behalf, and aims to provide a philosophically and formally rigorous introduction to formal logic through the soundness and completeness of first-order logic with identity.

Although this text is written with greater formal rigor than is common of introductory textbooks in logic, I have aimed to preserve the friendly and accessible character of ForAllX, preserving its title.
Additionally, I have taken pains to discuss the philosophical foundations of logic which are often omitted in introductory books and simply assumed in more advanced treatments.

## Using this Textbook

The terms at MIT span fifteen weeks, two of which are devoted to soundness and completeness for propositional logic (PL) and another two weeks to extend these results to first-order logic with identity (FOL).
In order to introduce the material at a slower rate or over the course of a shorter term, the metalogical portions of the text can easily be omitted without compromising the integrity of the text.

I have included the [LaTeX files](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ForAllX/tree/master/Lectures) for the [lecture notes](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ForAllX/blob/master/Handouts/All_Handouts.pdf) as well as the [syllabus](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ForAllX/blob/master/Syllabus/Syllabus.pdf) for the MIT course.
Feel free to contact me if you would like access to the exams, written problem sets, and assignments on [Carnap](https://carnap.io/).
