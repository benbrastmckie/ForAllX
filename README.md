# An Introduction to Formal Logic

This book provides a philosophically and formally rigorous introduction to Formal Logic through the soundness and completeness of first-order logic with identity.
This project is descendant of the open source logic textbook [ForAllX](https://www.fecundity.com/logic/) which has been heavily revised for teaching Logic I at MIT.
The metalogical portions of the text can easily be omitted without compromising the integrity of the text.
I have included [lecture notes](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ForAllX/tree/master/Lectures) as well as a syllabus for the MIT course.
Feel free to contact me if you would like access to the assignments.
