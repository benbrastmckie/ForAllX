# An Introduction to Formal Logic

This project is descendant of the open source logic textbook [ForAllX](https://www.fecundity.com/logic/) which has been heavily revised for teaching Logic I at MIT.
Whereas introductory courses in logic often draw students with diverse formal backgrounds, the undergraduate students taking logic at MIT tend to have strong formal backgrounds.
This textbook and course was designed on their behalf, and aims to provide a philosophically and formally rigorous introduction to formal logic through the soundness and completeness of first-order logic with identity.
Although the text is written with greater formal rigor than is common of introductory textbooks in logic, I have aimed to preserve the friendly and accessible character of the ForAllX textbooks.
Additionally, I have taken pains to discuss the philosophical underpinnings of the subject which are often left behind in other introductory books and assumed by more advanced treatments.

The metalogical portions of the text can easily be omitted without compromising the integrity of the text.
I have included [lecture notes](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ForAllX/tree/master/Lectures) as well as the [syllabus](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/ForAllX/blob/master/Syllabus/Syllabus.pdf) for the MIT course.
Feel free to contact me if you would like access to the exams, written problem sets, and assignments on [Carnap](https://carnap.io/).
