%started 9-1-22 to keep track of changes in local folder
%changed some picture files and the metadata; all handouts compile! (just had to take out the final santa claus proof, since it generated an error for some reason :( 


9-3-22:

Calgary goes to Chicago

Edmonton goes to Erie

Links to replace (to my own practice set, rather than Zach's):
Lecture 4 ``we'll illustratte using the"; just search `carnap' 

Lecture 6: ``test solutions on carnap"
Lecture 7: ``let's do it on carnap"
Lecture 10






9-1-22:

%going to try now to swap in my modified UBC style file and see what happens! 
running into lots of little problems w/ my style file, so maybe better to just selectively modify Zach's style file and also his fitch file! 

but this may be simply b/c i forgot to commont out xyyc sty file while calling my own in common.tex....doh

after all this, still get a microtype clash...

so bailing on this wholesale repalcement and will modify a xycc local sty file piecemeal! 

made piecemeal changes local.sty and fitch.sty and they seem to work!!!!!! going to try now to import fitch changes

doesn't change his truth-function symbols automatically, so he must have bailed on the universal/editable commands (bummer!)

but seems that it actually WASN'T autocalling local style file! runs into problem w/ forest 
included prooftrees in .sty folder and called this in local sty

made it all the way to slide 391 before a problem!!!! so lectures 0-11 compile! 

Issues w/ lecture 12, not sure what. maybe w/ the arrays? something is incompatible based on mods i made to local style file. maybe not worth figuring it out: lecture 12 is stuff on functional completeness of connectives (e.g. nand) and normal forms. would be nice as a supplement though! but maybe i can modify this slide locally in the zach slide deck using his style file. 

does have a nice slide on scope of a connective, which could be great to include early on! 

connectives have updated in the slides-01 file but NOT the handout-01 and not sure why... both call common
weird b/c it DID update the connectives in handout-02. 

in fact, nothing in handout-01 seems to beupdating, even as I change the lectures-01 file! this is SUPER bizzarre. 

lol, seems i just had opened the file of same name from ZACH lecture folders. faceplant! 

Fixed issue with Lecture 12!!! seems that some of the column arrays didn't work well w/ my \eand command (which was auto replacing some \land commands). so i replaced the problem \land commands with \&. had to make about four replacements, and it worked! 

MODIFICATIONS TO SELINGER FITCH WORKED!!! so my modified by command compiles perfectly!!!! so the natural deduction derivations in lecture 4 have the right syntax for me! 

just need to add in \pr and \as commands! 

and still need to make fitch.sty compatible w/ kluwer fitch, jtapp fitch, and gordon, so that i can easily copy/paste whatever into this
[might also prefer vertical format of jtapp notes for some longer proofs...] 


9-1-22: did all of the following in lectures 1-13; honestly not that many occurances...

TFL -> SL

FOL -> QL 

jointly possible -> consistent

Joint possibility -> Consistency 

jointly impossible -> inconsistent 

Joint impossibility -> Inconsistency

necessary truth -> tautology 

necessary equivalence -> logical equivalence 

necessarily equivalent -> logically equivalent or just equivalent 

uppercase could matter, e.g. for slide titles. so might want to do a case sensitive replace?
