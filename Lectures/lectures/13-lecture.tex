% % It's perhaps interesting to think about why we do not have to demonstrate soundness and completeness results for truthtables. It is almost as if the syntax for truthtables is constitutive of the semantics.

% Could also make some verbal remarks about the notion of mathematical rigor, and how this has evolved over time. And how it might still be contested today, and issues of how rigorous physics ought to be remain highly relevant. Different methodological styles in physics and mathematical physics

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Let $\Gamma$ be any set of \textit{sentences} of QL and $\Theta$ any sentence of QL. 

\item By proving that our derivation system is \textit{sound}, we show that QND derivations are `safe' (they preserve truth)

\medskip 

\bi

\item \emph{Sound}: If $\Gamma \vdash_{QND} \Theta$, then $\Gamma \entails \Theta$
%Single turnstile entails Double Turnstile 

\item (syntactic to semantic: i.e. we chose `good' rules!)

\ei

\bigskip 

\item By proving that QND is \textit{complete}, we show that reasoning about arbitrary models is not needed to demonstrate validity: \\ QND derivations suffice
%what about showing a set of sentences is unsatisfiable though? can we just not do this w/ SND derivations? would we need to introduce a falsum symbol? 

\medskip

\bi
\item recall that the atomic sentences of SL are 0th-place predicates
\ei
\item An $\mathfrak{L}$-model $\mathfrak{M} := (D, I)$ consists of

\begin{enumerate}

\item A non-empty set $D$ of objects, called the domain of   $\mathfrak{M}$

\item A map I (the \textit{interpretation} of $\mathfrak{M}$), which maps the vocabulary of $\mathfrak{L}$ to objects and ordered pairs from $D$ as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item For each constant $c \in \mathfrak{L}$, $I(c)$ is an element of $D$, called the \textit{referent} or denotation of $c$

\item For each k-place predicate $P$ of $\mathfrak{L}$, $I(P)$ is a set of ordered $k$-tuples of objects in $D$, called the \textit{extension} of $P$
% $k$-place relation defined on $D$, 
% GB: you can think of a k-place relation as a subset of $D^k$, i.e. the space of k-tuples of objects in D.

\item This is a wff of QL but not a sentence (it is neither true nor false in a model)

\item Idea: for each object $r$ in $D$, we know whether $Px$ \textit{would be true} if we replaced $r$ for $x$, i.e. if $x$ stood for $r$ \\ (b/c we know the extension of $P$, i.e. all the objects that are $P$)

\item \textit{Shorthand}:if $Pc$ is true in $\mathfrak{M}$, then $I(c)$ \alert{satisfies} $Px$ in $\mathfrak{M}$
% if $Pr$ is true in $\mathfrak{M}$, then $r$ \alert{satisfies} $Px$ in $\mathfrak{M}$

\item \textit{Longhand}: define a variable assignment $\mathbf{d}_I$ that maps variables to objects. Then $\mathbf{d}_I$ \emph{satisfies} $Px$ provided that $\mathbf{d}_I (x)$ has property I(P). We can write $\mathfrak{M}_{\mathbf{d}_I} \entails Px$

\item $I$ assigns constants to objects $t_i^D$; $d_I$ maps variables to objects $t_i^D$ \\ (the text calls these denotations under $I$ or $d_I$ ``den$_{I, d_I} (t_i)$'')

\item $d_I$ satisfies $\metav{Q}$ provided that the k-tuple of these objects $\langle t_1^D, \dots , t_k^D \rangle$ lies in the extension of $\metav{Q}$, i.e. in $I(\metav{Q})$

\frametitle{From Satisfaction to Truth}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Focus on the sentences of QL, which have no free variables

\item \alert{Lemma}: given a model $\mathfrak{M} = (D, I)$ and a QL \textit{sentence} $\metav{P}$, either all variable assignments $d_I$ satisfy $\metav{P}$ or none do. 

\item Hence, we can define truth in a QL-model as follows: 

\item  A sentence $\metav{P}$ of QL is \emph{true} on model $\mathfrak{M}$ iff some variable assignment $d_I$ satisfies $\metav{P}$ in $\mathfrak{M}$

\item A sentence $\metav{P}$ of QL is \emph{false} on model $\mathfrak{M}$ otherwise, i.e. if no variable assignment $d_I$ satisfies $\metav{P}$ in $\mathfrak{M}$

%\item A sentence $\metav{P}$ of QL is true on model $\mathfrak{M}$ iff every variable assignment $d_I$ satisfies $\metav{P}$ in $\mathfrak{M}$

%\item A sentence $\metav{P}$ of QL is false on model $\mathfrak{M}$ iff NO variable assignment $d_I$ satisfies $\metav{P}$ in $\mathfrak{M}$

%on an interpretation $I$ (i.e. true in model $\mathfrak{M}_I$

% It seems like perhaps if I followed GB in focusing on the variable assignments that only make assignments to free variables, then I could define truth in a model more simply, namely as being satisfied by the trivial variable assignment $d_0$, which assigns no variables to any objects. This trivial variable assignment is the only one that applies when dealing with sentences, since there are no free variables in sentences.
%\item Now, consider the \textit{trivial variable assignment} $d_{I,0}$, which assigns no variables to any objects.

%From Righteousness to Soundness

\item Let $\Gamma$ be any set of QL sentences (possibly infinite)

\item If $\Gamma \vdash_{QND} \metav{P}$, then by definition there is a derivation from finitely-many premises $\Delta \subseteq \Gamma$, such that \metav{P} occurs on the final line and lies in the scope of $\Delta$ (i.e. $\Delta \vdash_{QND} \metav{P}$)

\item Then by righteousness, $\Delta \entails \metav{P}$

\item[] -- i.e. any model $\mathfrak{M}$ that makes $\Delta$ true must make $\metav{P}$ true
%any TVA that makes $\Delta$ true must make $\metav{P}$ true

%\item i.e. any TVA 

\item So there is no QL-model that makes all the sentences in $\Gamma$ true while making $\metav{P}$ false, so $\Gamma \entails \metav{P}$ as well

\item (recall that every premise of a derivation lies in its own scope)
%\item[] \qquad i.e. these premises be gettin' high off their own supply)

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Notice that for $\qt{\forall}{\script{x}}\metav{Q}\substitute{\script{c}}{\script{x}}$ to be a wff, $\script{x}$ must not already occur in sentence $\metav{Q}$, so $\metav{Q}$ can't already have a $\script{x}$-quantifier. 

\item So $ \script{x}$ occurs freely in $\metav{Q}\substitute{\script{c}}{\script{x}}$ as the \textbf{only} free variable \\ (since $\qt{\forall}{\script{x}}\metav{Q}\substitute{\script{c}}{\script{x}}$ is, by assumption, a sentence)

\item Hence, a variable assignment $d_I$ of free variables in $\metav{Q}\substitute{\script{c}}{\script{x}}$ to objects in $D$ amounts to a choice of object $r \in D$ to assign $\script{x}$

\item So $d_I$ must make some choice $r := I(c)$ of object to assign $\script{x}$
% %JH: am i cheating by assuming I(c)=r? or am i allowed to do this? or am I just defining r as the denotation of c? r could of course be denoted by other constants as well though...
%i think this is allowed b/c I'm saying 

\item Hence $d_I$ simply equals $d_I[r/ \script{x}]$. %\\ Assume also that $I(c) = r$

%Given this choice for $r$, $d_I$ simply equals $d_I[r/ \script{x}]$. Assume also that $I(c) = r$ %i.e. they agree everywhere, even with respect to assigning r for x, since d_I has to assign x to something and the variant makes the same choice 

\item By 11.1.1, $d_I$ satisfies $\metav{Q}\substitute{\script{c}}{\script{x}}$ iff $d_I[I(\script{c})/\script{x}]$ satisfies $\metav{Q}$

\item So $d_I$ and hence $d_I[r/ \script{x}]$ satisfies $\metav{Q}\substitute{\script{c}}{\script{x}}$

%\item By defN of true-in-QL, $d_I$ must satisfy $\metav{Q}$, so $d_I [r/x]$ satisfies $\metav{Q}\substitute{\script{c}}{\script{x}}$ in $\mathfrak{M}$

\item For each $r \in D$, we define a new model $\mathfrak{M}_r$ whose interpretation function $I_r$ is just like $I$ except that it assigns the constant $\script{c}$ to $r$ 

\item Now, $\mathfrak{M} \entails \Gamma$ and $\mathfrak{M}_r$ differs by $\mathfrak{M}$ only in how it interprets a symbol that does not occur in $\Gamma$. 

\item So by Locality, we have $\mathfrak{M}_r \entails \Gamma$ and hence $\mathfrak{M}_r \entails \metav{Q}$

\item So for each object $r \in D$, we have a $d_{I_r} [r/\script{x}]$ that satisfies $\metav{Q}\substitute{\script{c}}{\script{x}}$. 

%\item Define variable assignment $d'_I$ as  

\item This is equivalent to saying that for each $r \in D$, $d_I [r/\script{x}]$ satisfies $\metav{Q}\substitute{\script{c}}{\script{x}}$, since $d_I$ and each $d_{I_r}$ agree on what to assign every other variable besides possibly $\script{x}$

\item And by defN, this means that $d_I$ satisfies $\qt{\forall}{\script{x}}\metav{Q}\substitute{\script{c}}{\script{x}}$, and hence this sentence is true in $\mathfrak{M}$

%\item So for each $r \in D$ there is a variable assignment 



%\item So, we know there is some variable assignment $d_I$ that satisfies $\metav{Q}$. We want to use this to show there is some assignment that satisfies $\qt{\forall}{\script{x}}\metav{Q}\substitute{\script{c}}{\script{x}}$, which requires it to satisfy Q for each r standing in for x. 



%\item Then by defN of true-in-QL, there is some variable assignment $d_I$ that satisfies $\metav{Q}[c]$ in $\mathfrak{M}$. Let $r$ be the object in $D$ that $c$ stands for.

\item One is \emph{semantic}: this is the notion we are already familiar with:

\item[] there is a TVA that \emph{satisfies} every sentence in the set

\item We introduce a new \textbf{syntactic} notion of consistency relative to our SND derivation system: 

\item[] -- a set of SL wffs is \textbf{SND-consistent} provided that you can't derive contradictory sentences from it in SND

\item Core proof idea: we'll show that if a set of sentences is \textbf{consistent-in-SND}, then it is also semantically consistent (i.e. \emph{satisfiable}). So by the contrapositive: if a set is \textbf{\textcolor{OGlyallpink}{un}}satisfiable, then it is \textbf{\textcolor{OGlyallpink}{in}}consistent-in-SND.

\subsubsection{Proof Sketch}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Proof Sketch}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Goal: prove the completeness of SL: for every SL wff $\metav{P}$ and every set $\Gamma$ of SL sentences, if $\Gamma \entails \metav{P}$ then $\Gamma \vdash \metav{P}$

\item So assume that $\Gamma \entails \metav{P}$. 

\item Recall from week 5: this means that $\Gamma \cup \{\enot \metav{P}\}$ is semantically inconsistent (i.e. \textbf{\textcolor{OGlyallpink}{unsatisfiable}}): \\ no TVA satisfies the premises and negated conclusion  

\item We now appeal to a \emph{Consistency lemma} that is the heart of the enterprise: any SND-consistent set of SL sentences is satisfiable (i.e. semantically consistent)

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Proof Sketch: Using the consistency lemma}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item \emph{Consistency lemma}: any SND-consistent set of SL sentences is satisfiable

\item \textbf{\textcolor{OGlyallpink}{Contrapositive}} of CL: any set of SL sentences that is \textcolor{OGlyallpink}{Un}satisfiable is SND-\textcolor{OGlyallpink}{In}consistent

\item From  $\Gamma \entails \metav{P}$ we know that $\Gamma \cup \{\enot \metav{P}\}$ is unsatisfiable

\item So by the contrapositive of CL, we see that $\Gamma \cup \{\enot \metav{P}\}$ is SND-inconsistent

\item This means that we can derive a pair of contradictory sentences $R$ and $\enot R$ from $\Gamma \cup \{\enot \metav{P}\}$! So using the power of negation elimination, we can derive $\metav{P}$ from $\Gamma$, i.e. $\Gamma \vdash \metav{P}$. So we are `done'!

\item Claim: if $\Gamma \cup \{\enot \metav{P}\}$ is \textbf{\textcolor{OGlyallpink}{SND-inconsistent}}, then $\Gamma \vdash \metav{P}$

\item Proof: starting with (finitely-many) premises $\Delta$ from $\Gamma$, introduce $\enot \metav{P}$ as a subproof assumption for negation elimination

\item Since $\Gamma \cup \{\enot \metav{P}\}$ is SND-inconsistent, we can derive a contradictory pair $R$ and $\enot R$ within the scope of wffs in $\Delta \cup \{\enot \metav{P}\}$

\item Then discharge this assumption $\enot \metav{P}$ by negation elimination, writing $\metav{P}$, now in the scope of $\Delta$. So $\Delta \vdash \metav{P}$

\item So all we have to do is prove the \emph{consistency lemma}: any SND-consistent set of SL sentences is satisfiable

\item The first two are straightforward: given an SND-consistent set $\Gamma$, we construct a \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{superset $\Gamma^{\ast}$}} that is \textit{\textcolor{blue}{maximally} SND-consistent}

\item In the third stage, we show that any maximally SND-consistent set is \alert{satisfiable}: we use maximal consistency to construct a TVA that satisfies every sentence in $\Gamma^{\ast}$

\item Since by construction $\Gamma \subseteq \Gamma^{\ast}$, this TVA satisfies $\Gamma$ as well. 

\item \footnotesize{(The idea in the third stage is similar to what we did with trees: use a syntactic consistency property to construct a TVA that satisfies a set of wffs: with trees we had `\textcolor{blue}{complete} \alert{open} branches'; here we have \textcolor{blue}{maximal}-\alert{SND-consistency})} 
\item The third stage comprises a tedious lemma and induction! \\ PS12 problems 2 and 3 provide practice with this tedium! 

%this is just like constructing a TVA that satisfies all of the sentences in

\item $\Gamma^{\ast}$ is SND-consistent (i.e. can't derive contradictory sentences)

\item adding \textbf{any} additional wff to $\Gamma^{\ast}$ would result in an SND-\textcolor{OGlyallpink}{inconsistent} set

\end{enumerate} 

\item i.e. for any $P \notin \Gamma^{\ast}$, $\{P\} \cup \Gamma^{\ast}$ is SND-\textcolor{OGlyallpink}{inconsistent}

\item Then consider the first wff `$A$' in our enumeration. \\ If $A$ can be added to $\Gamma$ without the resulting set being SND-inconsistent, then let  $\Gamma_1 := \Gamma \cup \{A\}$. 

\item Otherwise, let  $\Gamma_1 := \Gamma$ (so that $\Gamma_1$ stays SND-consistent)

% \item In general, if $P_k$ is the $k$-th sentence in our enumeration, then $\Gamma_{k+1}$ is $\Gamma_k \cup \{P_k\}$ provided $\Gamma_k \cup \{P_k\}$ is SND-consistent; \\ otherwise, $\Gamma_{k+1}$ equals $\Gamma_k$

\item Then, proceed to the second wff in our enumeration. \\ If it can be added to $\Gamma_1$ without the new set being SND-inconsistent, let $\Gamma_2$ be the result. Otherwise, let $\Gamma_2 := \Gamma_1$

\item $\Gamma^{\ast}$ is the result of `doing' this procedure for every SL wff

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Analogy: we can enumerate words by length, using their alphabetical order to break ties %(so that 5-letter words beginning w/ `a' come before those w/ `b')

\item Can do the same for SL wffs by stipulating an `alphabetical order':

\item $\enot, \eor, \eand, \eif, \eiff, (, ), 0, 1, \dots, 9, A, B, \dots, Z$

\item Each symbol is assigned an \textbf{index} between `10' and `55' %so 43 indices total: 55-10+1-3, since we actually skip 17, 18, and 19, starting 0 at `20' so that A starts at `30'

\item Then each SL wff corresponds to a unique positive integer, constructed by replacing each symbol in the wff with its index, from left to right. 

\item So with our ordering, `$A$' is the first wff; `$B$' the second \dots up to $Z$, and then we hit $\enot A$ ($\mapsto 1030$), then $\enot B$ ($\mapsto 1031$), etc.

\item[] $\Rightarrow$ there exists a wff $\metav{Q}$ that we could add to $\Gamma^{\ast}$ while preserving \alert{SND-consistency} (i.e. there would be some wff that we neglected that could make  $\Gamma^{\ast}$ an even `bigger' SND-consistent set)

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Maximal} \alert{Consistency Lemma}}: any set that is maximally-SND-consistent is satisfiable

\item So there exists a TVA that satisfies every sentence in $\Gamma^{\ast}$. \\ We construct this TVA, calling it ``$\metav{I}$" (the book calls it $\textbf{A}^{\ast}$)
%$\mathbf{A}^{\ast}$

\item Proof idea: since $\Gamma^{\ast}$ is M-SND-C, for any wff $\metav{Q}$, either $\metav{Q} \in \Gamma^{\ast}$ or $\textcolor{red}{\enot \metav{Q}} \in \Gamma^{\ast}$ (you're either in the club or your `\textcolor{red}{nemesis}' is!)
%you're out of the club!)

\item[] This holds in particular for each atomic wff

\item Define the TVA $\metav{I}$ such that $\metav{I}(B) = True$ iff atomic $B \in \Gamma^{\ast}$

\item Then by the recursive structure of SL wffs, $\metav{I}(\metav{Q}) = True$ iff $\metav{Q} \in \Gamma^{\ast}$

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item To induct on SL, we first show some constraints on $\Gamma^{\ast}$ membership

\item Basically, $\Gamma^{\ast}$ is like a club with a bouncer who enforces maximal consistency. Before the bouncer lets a wff into $\Gamma^{\ast}$, he checks who else is in the club 
%(the smaller fish, relative to our lexical ordering)

\item \emph{Membership Lemma} for club $\Gamma^{\ast}$: if \metav{P} and \metav{Q} are SL wffs, then:

\begin{enumerate}[a.)]

\item $\enot \metav{P} \in \Gamma^{\ast}$ if and only if $\metav{P} \notin \Gamma^{\ast}$

\item $\metav{P} \eand \metav{Q} \in \Gamma^{\ast}$ if and only if both $\metav{P}\in \Gamma^{\ast}$ and $\metav{Q}\in \Gamma^{\ast}$

\item $\metav{P} \eor \metav{Q} \in \Gamma^{\ast}$ if and only if either $\metav{P}\in \Gamma^{\ast}$ or $\metav{Q}\in \Gamma^{\ast}$

\item $\metav{P} \eif \metav{Q} \in \Gamma^{\ast}$ if and only if either $\metav{P}\notin \Gamma^{\ast}$ or $\metav{Q}\in \Gamma^{\ast}$

\item $\metav{P} \eiff \metav{Q} \in \Gamma^{\ast}$ iff either (i) $\metav{P}\in \Gamma^{\ast}$ and $\metav{Q}\in \Gamma^{\ast}$ or (ii) $\metav{P}\notin \Gamma^{\ast}$ and $\metav{Q}\notin \Gamma^{\ast}$

\frametitle{Stage 3 (i): Key Fact aka \emph{The Door} lemma (book's 6.4.9)}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item To prove the membership lemma's cases (a)--(e), we'll use another lemma (hint: it's lemmas all the way down):
%we'll use a lemma for a lemma

\item \emph{The Door}: if $\Gamma \vdash P$, and $\Gamma^{\ast}$ is a maximally SND-consistent superset of $\Gamma$, then $P \in \Gamma^{\ast}$ \\ (mnemonic: ``$\Gamma\vdash P$" pushes $P$ through the door!) %of our fictional club!
%Bouncer says yesssss)

\item Proof: first, assume that $\Gamma \vdash P$ (we'll use this fact below)

\item Next, assume for \textit{reductio} that $P \notin \Gamma^{\ast}$. Then since $\Gamma^{\ast}$ is maximally SND-consistent, $\Gamma^{\ast} \cup \{ P\}$ must be \textcolor{OGlyallpink}{inconsistent in SND}. 

\item Hence, by negation introduction, $\Gamma^{\ast} \vdash \enot P$

\item By assumption, $\Gamma \vdash P$, so also $\Gamma^{\ast} \vdash P$, since $\Gamma \subseteq \Gamma^{\ast}$

\item So $\Gamma^{\ast}$ derives both $P$ and $\enot P$. \textit{Reductio}! (since $\Gamma^{\ast}$ is M-SND-C)

\item Hence, if $\Gamma \vdash P$ and $\Gamma \subseteq \Gamma^{\ast}$, then $P$ must belong to $\Gamma^{\ast}$

\item Two directions to prove:

\item[] $\Rightarrow$: Assume $\enot \metav{P} \in \Gamma^{\ast}$. Then if  $\metav{P}$ were in $\Gamma^{\ast}$, we could derive contradictory sentences. 

\item[] So since $\Gamma^{\ast}$ is SND-consistent, we must have $\metav{P} \notin \Gamma^{\ast}$

\item[] $\Leftarrow$: Assume $\metav{P} \notin \Gamma^{\ast}$. Then adding $\metav{P}$ to $\Gamma^{\ast}$ results in an SND-inconsistent set. Hence, there is some finite subset $\Delta \subset \Gamma^{\ast}$ s.t. $\Delta \cup \{ \metav{P}\}$ is SND-inconsistent (i.e. derives contradictory sentence pair). 

\item So by negation introduction, $\Delta \vdash \enot \metav{P}$

%it is clubbin

(ii) (the $\Leftarrow$direction) if $\metav{P} \in \Gamma^{\ast}$, then $\metav{I}(\metav{P}) = True$
\item[] (\textit{Alternative (ii)}: show contrapositive: if $\metav{I}(\metav{P}) = 0$, then $\metav{P} \notin \Gamma^{\ast}$)

\item[$\Rightarrow$] if $\metav{I}(\metav{P}) = 1$, then $\metav{I}(\metav{Q}) = 0$. Since \metav{Q} is clubbin', we have $\metav{Q} \notin \Gamma^{\ast}$. 
\item[] By Membership lemma (a), $\textcolor{red}{\enot \metav{Q}} \in \Gamma^{\ast}$, so $\metav{P} \in \Gamma^{\ast}$

\item[$\Leftarrow$] if $\metav{P} \in \Gamma^{\ast}$, then $\enot \metav{Q} \in \Gamma^{\ast}$. So by Membership lemma (a), $\metav{Q} \notin \Gamma^{\ast}$. 
\item[] Since \metav{Q} is clubbin', we have $\metav{I}(\metav{Q}) = 0$. \item[] So by the truth conditions for negation, $\metav{I}(\metav{P}) = 1$
