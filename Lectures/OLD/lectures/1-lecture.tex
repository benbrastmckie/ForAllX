  \begin{block}<1->{Argument 2 (Paraphrased)}
    Mandy enjoys skiing or Mandy enjoys hiking.\\
    Not: Mandy enjoy hiking.\\

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Symbolization keys}

  \begin{definition}
    A symbolization key is a list that pairs \emph{sentence letters} with
    the basic English sentences they represent.
  \end{definition}

  For instance:

  \begin{block}{Symbolization key}
    $S$: Mandy enjoys skiing\\
    $H$: Mandy enjoys hiking
  \end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Symbolization keys}

  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item Sentence letters are UPPERCASE, possibly with subscripts
  (e.g., $H_1$, $H_2$).
  \item Usually the symbolization key is given to you \footnotesize{(to facilitate grading ;)}
  \item It should not be possible to further decompose the ``atomic
  sentences'' represented by sentence letters.

  \item[] For instance:
  \centerline{$B$: Mandy enjoys skiing or hiking}
  is a \textcolor{red}{bad} choice of symbolization.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Paraphrase}

  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item Successful symbolization sometimes requires \emph{paraphrase} to
  ensure atomic sentences appear explicitly.
  \item Two things to watch for: pronouns and coordination.
  \item Pronouns stand in for singular terms (e.g., names): \\ explicitly replace
  pronouns by those names.
  \item ``or'', ``both \dots and'', ``neither \dots nor'' can connect sentences but
  also noun phrases and verb phrases: \\ paraphrase them so that they connect
  sentences.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Pronouns}

  \begin{block}{Example}
    If Mandy enjoys hiking, \emph{she} also enjoys skiing.

    Replace ``she'' by ``Mandy'':\\
    If [Mandy enjoys hiking] then [Mandy enjoys skiing].
  \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Coordination of noun phrases}

  \begin{block}{Example}
    \emph{Mandy and Sanjeev} enjoy hiking.

    Both [Mandy enjoys hiking] and [Sanjeev enjoys hiking].
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Example}
    Sanjeev lives in \emph{Erie or Chicago}.

    Either [Sanjeev lives in Erie] or [Sanjeev lives in Chicago].
  \end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Exercise caution!}

  \begin{block}{Good}
    \emph{Mandy and Sanjeev} ate pizza.

    Both [Mandy ate pizza] and [Sanjeev ate pizza].
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{\textcolor{red}{Bad}}
    \emph{Mandy and Sanjeev} ate the whole pizza.

    Both [Mandy ate the whole pizza] and [Sanjeev ate the whole pizza].
  \end{block}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Coordination of verb phrases}

  \begin{block}{Example}
  Mandy enjoys \emph{skiing or hiking}.

  Either [Mandy enjoys skiing] or [Mandy enjoys hiking].
  \end{block}

  \begin{block}{Example}
  If Sanjeev enjoys \emph{skiing and hiking}, he lives in Chicago.

  If [Sanjeev enjoys skiing] and [Sanjeev enjoys hiking], then [Sanjeev lives in Chicago].
  \end{block}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Basic symbolization}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Negation}

  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item \emph{Paraphrase} grammatical negation (``is not'', ``does not'') using the
  corresponding atomic sentence prefixed by ``\emph{it is not the case that}.''

  \item \emph{Symbolize} ``it is not the case that $A$'' as
  \emph{$\lnot A$}.

  \begin{block}{Example}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item[] Mandy \emph{doesn't} enjoy skiing.
    \item[] It is not the case that [\emph{Mandy enjoys skiing}].
    \item[] \emph{It is not the case that} $S$.
    \item[] $\lnot S$
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Conjunction}

  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item \emph{Paraphrase} sentences connected by ``and'', ``but'', ``even
  though'', ``yet'', and ``although'' using
  ``\emph{both $A$ and $B$}''

  \item \emph{Symbolize} ``both $A$ and $B$'' as
  \emph{$(A \land B)$}.

  \begin{block}{Example}
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item[] \emph{Even though} Mandy lives in Erie\emph{,} she enjoys hiking.

  \item[] Both [\emph{Mandy lives in Erie}] and [\emph{Mandy enjoys hiking}].

  \item[] \emph{Both} $E$ \emph{and} $H$.

  \item[] $(E \land H)$

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Disjunction (it's inclusive!)}

  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item \emph{Paraphrase} sentences connected by ``or'' using\\
  ``\emph{either $A$ or $B$}''

  \item \emph{Symbolize} ``either $A$ or $B$'' as
  \emph{$(A \lor B)$}.

  \begin{block}{Example}
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item[] Sanjeev lives in Chicago \emph{or} Erie.

  \item[] Either [\emph{Sanjeev lives in Chicago}] or [\emph{Sanjeev lives in Erie}].

  \item[] \emph{Either} $C$ \emph{or} $E$.

  \item[] $(C \lor E)$
  \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  
  \item[] Ignore the suggestion that ``either \dots or \dots'' is exclusive.
  We'll always treat it as inclusive unless explicitly stated.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Conditional (it's material!)}

  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item \emph{Paraphrase} using ``\emph{if $A$ then $B$}'' any sentence of the form:
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
  \item ``if $A$, $B$''
  \item ``$B$ if $A$'' (note order is reversed with lonely if!)
  \item ``$B$ provided $A$'';  and also  ``$B$ given $A$''
  \end{itemize}
  \item \emph{Symbolize} ``if $A$ then $B$'' as
  \emph{$(A \eif B)$}.
\item[] note our funny `horseshoe' symbol `\eif'.  \item[] \centerline{Round `em up! (On \textit{Carnap} use `$>$')}

  \begin{block}{Example}

\begin{frame}{The parts of a conditional}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{$(A \eif B)$} symbolizes:

    \item ``if $A$, $B$''
    \item ``$B$ if $A$'' (note order is reversed!)
    \item ``$B$ provided $A$''
  \end{itemize}
  \item $A$ is the \emph{antecedent}: it symbolizes the condition that has to
  be met for the ``then'' part to apply. (Like a promise!)
  \item $B$ is the \emph{consequent}: it symbolizes what must be true (e.g. to keep your promise!)
  if the antecedent condition is true.

\subsection{Defining Formulae in SL}

\frame{\frametitle{Will the real SL please stand up?}
%\large

What we have said so far about Sentential Logic (SL): 
\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Uppercase letters, subscripts allowed: e.g. $J, H, B, N_3$

\item Punctuation: parentheses `(' and `)' ;(no brackets or braces!)

\item Connectives: $\enot, \eand, \eor, \eif, \eiff$

\item But so is any string of these symbols a legitimate formula of SL?

\item e.g. $((((A\eand \enot (B \eif C \eiff D((( $ 

\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Expressions vs. Well-formed Formula (WFFs)}
%\large
\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item \emph{Expression of SL}: any finite string of symbols from language SL

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Includes ridiculous-seeming strings, e.g. $((((())LOGIC_1FOREVER((($ 

\end{itemize}

\item \emph{Well-formed Formulae} (WFFs): often shortened to `formulae' or `\emph{sentences}' of SL

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item These are the expressions we are interested in

\item They end up being expressions that are true or false under an assignment of truth values to atomic sentence letters 

\end{itemize}

\item But how do we rigorously define the WFFs as a subset of the expressions? 

\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Look it's a bird! It's a plane! It's....RECURSION!}
%\large

We define the well-formed formulae (wffs) \textit{recursively}: 
\begin{enumerate}[<+->]

\item Each atomic sentence is a wff (base case)

\item If $\metav{P}$ is a wff, then so is $\enot \metav{P}$

\item If $\metav{P}$ and $\metav{Q}$ are both wffs, then so are:

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item   $(\metav{P} \eand  \metav{Q})$

\item   $(\metav{P} \eor  \metav{Q})$

\item   $(\metav{P} \eif  \metav{Q})$

\item   $(\metav{P} \eiff  \metav{Q})$

\end{itemize}

\item And that's all folks! (No other expressions of SL are wffs)


\end{enumerate}
}

\frame{\frametitle{Identifying the Main Connective}
%\large
\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Apply the recursive definition in reverse! 

\bigskip

\item Ask if the sentence is a negation of another wff

\item If not, locate the two wffs in the scope of the outermost parentheses, and figure out which connective combines them 

\item Rinse and repeat: stop when you reach the atomic sentences

\item SL is an object language we talk about using English

\item When we talk about SL, we MENTION expressions in SL, and thereby should technically put quotation marks around these:

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item \textcolor{red}{BAD}: $P \eand Q$ is a sentence in SL

\item \emph{GOOD}: ``$P \eand Q$'' is a sentence in SL

\item We have to mention ``$P \eand Q$'' since it is not a sentence in English; it's a sentence in SL. So we can't \textit{use} it in English.

\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item  ``Obama'' names the 44th president of the USA

\item ``Obama'' names Obama; ``Obama'' is a name.

    \frametitle{Types of ambiguity}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Lexical ambiguity: one word---many meanings \\
  e.g., ``bank'', ``crane''
  \item Syntactic ambiguity: one sentence---many readings\\
  e.g.,
  \begin{itemize}
  \item ``Flying planes can be dangerous'' (Chomsky)
  \item ``One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas.\\ How he got in my pajamas, I don't know.'' (Groucho Marx)
  \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Ambiguity of \eand{} and \eor}

  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item English sentences don't have parentheses.
    \item This can lead to ambiguity, e.g.,
    \begin{earg}
      \item[] Ahmed admires Brit and Cara or Dina.
    \end{earg}
    \item It might mean one of:
    \begin{earg}
      \item[] Ahmed admires either [both Brit and Cara] or Dina.
      \item[] Ahmed admires both Brit and [either Cara or Dina].
    \end{earg}
    \item In SL, symbolizations are unambiguous:
    \begin{earg}
      \item[] $((B \eand C) \eor D)$
      \item[] $(B \eand (C \eor D))$

%JRH: initially pretty difficult to understand the following example. Wiki page helps:
%``Casement's crimes had been carried out in Germany and the Treason Act 1351 seemed to apply only to activities carried out on English (or arguably British) soil. A close reading of the Act allowed for a broader interpretation: the court decided that a comma should be read in the unpunctuated original Norman-French text, crucially altering the sense so that "in the realm or elsewhere" referred to where acts were done and not just to where the "King's enemies" might be."
