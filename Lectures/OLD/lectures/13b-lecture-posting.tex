% %version that takes out some explicit content haha 

% I suppose that in many ways, the style of proof that I provide here (similar to Gordon's) is better than how the logic book remains entirely within QL. The proof that I provide obviously generalizes to any first-order language. You simply consider an extension of that language that adds a new symbol, allowing you to consider infinitely-more constants.

% Perhaps the reason why there cannot be a constructive proof of completeness for predicate logic: if we knew how to construct a (finite) natural deduction for any valid argument, then we would have a decision procedure for determining validity. Yet, we know that predicate logic is undecidable. So perhaps this is what gives us knowledge of the impossibility of having a constructive proof (since otherwise, you might just think that people haven't tried hard enough, but that such a proof could be found)

% At the end of my modified proof, I can presumably appeal to one of the isomorphism results shown in Belot logic notes. Basically, the model M and the model M prime are isomorphic, so they should Entail isomorphic statements


% Easier proof idea: construct $\Gamma'$ such that the starting $\Gamma$ remains a subset. So rather than mapping un-primed subscripted constants to primed ones, just allow us in constructing $\Gamma^{\ast}$ to appeal to a new batch of constants in the language QL', namely coming from a new batch of number indices, allowed only for constants. 
%, I'll be able to avoid the appeals to 11.1.13 and 11.4.8. Instead, I'll just be able to note immediately, as Gordon does, that since each sentence in $\Gamma$ belongs to $\Gamma^{\ast}$ , satisfying the latter satisfies the former. So then everything is completely parallel to what we were doing for SL

% I think I will need some kind of lemma like the following: if a set of QL-sentences is satisfied in a QL' model, then there exists a QL-model that satisfies it. 
% Simple idea that at least should work based on the way that we have constructed the model for $\Gamma^{\ast}$ : construct the relevant model M for the starting QL-sentences $\Gamma$  by simply defining it over the subset domain that excludes the primed-constants. And define it's interpreation function as a restriction of the one for M*. Then this is a well-defined QL-model that satisfies $\Gamma$ .
% Is there something that I really ought to proof your? E.g. involving a kind of isomorphism or a locality principle? I technically could not use locality as stated since that relies on having the same domain.

% % But maybe there is a much easier way of proceeding, using locality. Construct the QL-model such that it does have the same domain, and construct the QL-interpretation functions such that it is a restriction of the one for QL'. Then considering any QL-sentence from $\Gamma$ , it seems like locality straightforwardly applies
% problem: locality as stated applies only to two QL-models, and here I am comparing a QL' model to a QL-model....

% Maybe I should just proceed directly from the truth-conditions for QL sentences: given a variable assignment in the primed model, restrict this to the unprimed model and argue that it satisfies the QL sentence. i.e. use a d_I' to define a d_I that meets the truth conditions! 

% % % Easiest way out of this muddle:, which perhaps embarrassingly I did not see before. Just note that the model M* we construct is not just a QL' model for $\Gamma^{\ast}$  BUT ALSO a QL-model for  $\Gamma$ . This is simply because it meets the definition of a QL-model: we have a domain (which includes constants from QL' but now functioning as `objects') and a map I that maps all the stuff in QL to stuff in the domain. namely our I is the restriction of the I* in M*, restricted to symbols in QL, all of which appear in QL'. so we're done!!!! 

% One remaining possible worry: if the domain is the same in these two models, then how can the QL sentence (Ax)Px be true if much of what is in the domain is the primed-subscripted constants? By the satisfaction conditions for universal quantification, we would need the variant d_I[r/x] to satisfy P FOR EVERY object r in the domain, including the primed-subscripted constants. but then what are the names for these things??? do we necessarily need names for these things?

% Regardless though, it still seems like the definition of a QL-model is automatically satisfied. so maybe we just keep the same extensions for everything and it's just the case that not every object in the domain has a name in QL and that's fine (?) 

% Is this a unique worry to the way that I/Gordon am going about this? Or does the same kind of worry arise for what the logic book does with the even-subscripted set?

% % Completely satisfying resolution to my worry: note that to satisfy an existential, we don't require that our model has a name for every object in the domain. E.g. on Carnap problem set 9, we just needed something in the domain to be in the extension of the predicate. We often didn't have any constants, or we had way fewer constants. e.g. one constant b which names 2. but (Ex)Px for there is a prime could still be true provided we put 3 in the extension of P. 
% so even though language QL won't be able to name a lot of stuff in the domain (namely, all of the subscripted primed constants), that stuff in the domain can still make a lot of the relevant universals and existentials in $\Gamma$  true in our QL-model.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item As with SND, we appeal to two distinct notions of consistency

\item One is \emph{semantic}: %this is the notion we are already familiar with:

\item[] there is a QL-model that \emph{satisfies} every sentence in the set

\item We introduce a new \textbf{syntactic} notion of consistency relative to QND:

\item[] -- a set of QL sentences is \textbf{QND-consistent} provided that you can't derive contradictory sentences from it in QND

\item Core proof idea: we'll show that if a set of sentences is \textbf{QND-consistent}, then it is also semantically consistent (i.e. \emph{satisfiable}). So by the contrapositive: if a set is \textbf{\textcolor{OGlyallpink}{un}}satisfiable, then it is \textbf{\textcolor{OGlyallpink}{in}}consistent-in-QND.

%\begin{itemize}

\item This is a \textit{semantic} notion of consistency \\ (aka ``quantificational consistency'')

\item \textbf{\textcolor{OGlyallpink}{Inconsistent-in-QND}}: from premises in $\Gamma$, we can derive contradictory formulas $R$ and $\enot R$ in the scope of the main scope line (i.e. in the scope of these premises)

\item \emph{Consistent-in-QND}: $\Gamma$ is not QND-inconsistent, i.e. there is no derivation from premises in $\Gamma$ resulting in contradictory formulas within the main scope

\subsection{Proof Sketch}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Proof Sketch: Just like what we did for SL!}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Goal: prove the completeness of QL: for every QL sentence $\metav{P}$ and every set $\Gamma$ of QL sentences, if $\Gamma \entails \metav{P}$ then $\Gamma \vdash_{QND} \metav{P}$

\item So assume that $\Gamma \entails \metav{P}$. 

\item This means that $\Gamma \cup \{\enot \metav{P}\}$ is \textbf{\textcolor{OGlyallpink}{unsatisfiable}}:\\ no QL-model satisfies the premises and negated conclusion \\ (i.e. $\Gamma \cup \{\enot \metav{P}\}$ is \textit{semantically} inconsistent)

\item We now appeal to a \emph{Consistency lemma} that remains the heart of the enterprise: any QND-consistent set of QL sentences is satisfiable (i.e. semantically consistent)

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Proof Sketch: Using the consistency lemma}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item \emph{Consistency lemma} (CL): any QND-consistent set of QL sentences is satisfiable, i.e. true in some QL-model $\mathfrak{M}$

\item \textbf{\textcolor{OGlyallpink}{Contrapositive}} of CL: any set of QL sentences that is \textcolor{OGlyallpink}{Un}satisfiable is QND-\textcolor{OGlyallpink}{In}consistent

\item From  $\Gamma \entails \metav{P}$ we know that $\Gamma \cup \{\enot \metav{P}\}$ is unsatisfiable

\item So by the contrapositive of CL, we see that $\Gamma \cup \{\enot \metav{P}\}$ is QND-inconsistent

\item This means that we can derive a pair of contradictory sentences $R$ and $\enot R$ from $\Gamma \cup \{\enot \metav{P}\}$! So using the power of negation elimination, we can derive $\metav{P}$ from $\Gamma$, i.e. $\Gamma \vdash_{QND} \metav{P}$. So we are `done'!

\begin{itemize}

\item Claim: if $\Gamma \cup \{\enot \metav{P}\}$ is \textbf{\textcolor{OGlyallpink}{QND-inconsistent}}, then $\Gamma \vdash_{QND} \metav{P}$

\item Proof: starting with (finitely-many) premises $\Delta$ from $\Gamma$, introduce $\enot \metav{P}$ as a subproof assumption for negation elimination

\item Since $\Gamma \cup \{\enot \metav{P}\}$ is QND-inconsistent, we can derive a contradictory pair $R$ and $\enot R$ within the scope of sentences in $\Delta \cup \{\enot \metav{P}\}$

\item Then discharge this assumption $\enot \metav{P}$ by negation elimination, writing $\metav{P}$, now in the scope of $\Delta$. So $\Delta \vdash_{QND} \metav{P}$

\item So all we have to do is prove the \emph{consistency lemma}: any QND-consistent set of QL sentences is satisfiable

\item As with SL, we'll prove this lemma in several `stages':

\item The first two are straightforward: given a QND-consistent set $\Gamma$, we construct a \textbf{\textcolor{blue}{superset $\Gamma^{\ast}$}} that is \textit{\textcolor{blue}{maximally} QND-consistent} and \textit{\textcolor{purple}{existentially complete}} ($\exists$-complete)

\item In the third stage, we show that any $\exists$-complete, maximally QND-consistent set is \alert{satisfiable}: we use maximal consistency and $\exists$-completeness to construct a model that satisfies every sentence in $\Gamma^{\ast}$. \textit{Wrinkle}: we work in an extended language QL$'$!

\item Since by construction $\Gamma \subseteq \Gamma^{\ast}$, this QL$'$-model satisfies $\Gamma$ (in QL$'$)

\item From our QL$'$-model, we generate a QL-model that satisfies $\Gamma$  

%\item \footnotesize{(The idea in the third stage is similar to what we did with trees: use a syntactic consistency property to construct a TVA that satisfies a set of sentences: with trees we had `\textcolor{blue}{complete} \alert{open} branches'; here we have \textcolor{blue}{maximal}-\alert{QND-consistency})} 

%\item The final stage extends our membership lemma and induction!

\bigskip 

\item Motivation: $\qt{\exists}{\script{x}} \metav{P}$ is true in a model iff some object $r \in D$ is a $\metav{P}$ 

%\item Ultimately, we'll use the recursive structure of QL$'$ and a membership lemma for $\Gamma^{\ast}$ that relies on ``truth-condition pieces"

\item To construct an $\exists$-complete set $\Gamma^{\ast}$, we need recourse to a countable infinity of unused constants. 

\item Otherwise, new substitution instances that we add could ``contradict" sentences already in $\Gamma$, spoiling QND-consistency

\frametitle{Stage 1(i): first enumerate the sentences of QL$'$!}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Let $\Gamma$ be a QND-consistent set of QL sentences (possibly infinite)

\item To construct $\Gamma^{\ast}$, we first \emph{enumerate} the QL$'$ sentences, so that every QL$'$ sentence is associated with a unique positive integer $\{1, 2, 3, \dots \}$

%\item Analogy: we can enumerate words by length, using their alphabetical order to break ties %(so that 5-letter words beginning w/ `a' come before those w/ `b')

\item As with SL, stipulate an `alphabetical order' for QL$'$ symbols

\item $\enot, \eor, \eand, \eif, \eiff, (, ), 0, 1, \dots, 9, A, B, \dots, Z$, \emph{$a$}, $\dots, v,$ \emph{$w$}, $x, y, z,$ \emph{$\forall$}, \emph{$\exists$}, \emph{$^{\prime}$}

\item Assign each symbol an \textbf{index} between `10' and `84' (skip 17--19) %so 43 indices total: 55-10+1-3, since we actually skip 17, 18, and 19, starting 0 at `20' so that A starts at `30'

\item Then each QL$'$ sentence corresponds to a unique positive integer, constructed by replacing each symbol in the sentence with its index, from left to right. 

\item So with our ordering, `$A$' is the first sentence; `$B$' the second \dots up to $Z$, and then we hit $\enot A$ ($\mapsto 1030$), then $\enot B$ ($\mapsto 1031$), etc.

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Recall what we did in SL to form $\Gamma^{\ast}$ Max.-SND-Consist.}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item We considered the first sentence `$A$' in our enumeration. \\ If $A$ could be added to $\Gamma$ without the resulting set being SND-inconsistent, then we let  $\Gamma_1 := \Gamma \cup \{A\}$. 

\item Otherwise, let $\Gamma_1 := \Gamma$ (so that $\Gamma_1$ stays SND-consistent)

% \item In general, if $P_k$ is the $k$-th sentence in our enumeration, then $\Gamma_{k+1}$ is $\Gamma_k \cup \{P_k\}$ provided $\Gamma_k \cup \{P_k\}$ is SND-consistent; \\ otherwise, $\Gamma_{k+1}$ equals $\Gamma_k$

\item We proceeded to the 2nd sentence in our enumeration. \\ If it could be added to $\Gamma_1$ without the new set being SND-inconsistent, let $\Gamma_2$ be the result. Otherwise, let $\Gamma_2 := \Gamma_1$

\item $\Gamma^{\ast}$ was the result of `doing' this procedure for every SL sentence

\item Now we need to complicate matters a bit, to handle sentences of the form $\qt{\exists}{\script{x}} \metav{P}$ and ensure we add a suitable substitution instance whenever we can add $\qt{\exists}{\script{x}} \metav{P}$ while preserving QND-consistency

%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Assume for \textit{reductio} that $\Gamma^{\ast}$ is inconsistent in QND

\item Then there would be a QND derivation with finite premise set $\Delta \subset \Gamma^{\ast}$ that derives a contradictory pair $R$ and $\enot R$

\item Since $\Delta$ is finite, there exists some $k+1 \in \mathbb{N}$ s.t. $\Delta \subset \Gamma_{k+1}$. \\ So then this $\Gamma_{k+1}$ would be \textcolor{OGlyallpink}{QND-inconsistent}. 

\item Yet, each $\Gamma_{k+1}$ is necessarily \alert{QND-consistent}: 

\bi

%\item Case where we don't add $P_k$: $\Gamma_{k+1} = $\Gamma_{k}$ which we assume is QND-consistent

\item If $P_k$ is not existential, it joins $\Gamma_{k+1}$ only if $\Gamma_k \cup \{P_k \}$ is QND-consistent---by condition (ii)

\item If $P_k$ is of the form $\qt{\exists}{\script{x}} \metav{Q}$, it joins only if $\Gamma_k \cup \{P_k \}$ is QND-consistent. 
\item[] -- It remains to show that $\Gamma_k \cup \{\qt{\exists}{\script{x}} \metav{Q}, \metav{Q}\substitute{\script{x}}{\script{c}} \}$ is QND-consistent

\item \textbf{\textcolor{highlightB}{Lemma}}: if $\script{c}$ does not occur in a QND-C set $\Gamma_k \cup \{ \qt{\exists}{\script{x}} \metav{Q} \}$, then $\Gamma_k \cup \{\qt{\exists}{\script{x}} \metav{Q}, \metav{Q}\substitute{\script{x}}{\script{c}} \}$ is QND-consistent

%where $P^{\dagger}_k$ is a substitution instance $\metav{Q}\substitute{\script{x}}{\script{c}}$

%\item For each sentence $P_k$, we ``added" $P_k$ (and possibly a substitution instance) to $\Gamma_{k+1}$ only if the resulting set was QND-consistent

%\item In general, if $P_k$ is the $k$-th sentence in our enumeration, then $\Gamma_{k+1}$ is $\Gamma_k \cup \{P_k\}$ provided that $\Gamma_k \cup \{P_k\}$ is QND-consistent; \\ otherwise, $\Gamma_{k+1}$ equals $\Gamma_k$ (so QND-consistent either way)

\ei

\item Hence, $\Gamma^{\ast}$ must be QND-consistent, on pain of \textit{reductio} 

% % Question: why do we need to manually add a substitution instance? Since the substitution instance will itself have a number $k$ in the enumeration, couldn't we just wait to consider it later? Perhaps the worry is that certain ways of building up would maintain QND-consistency but then systematically exclude every substitution instance of an existential in the set. Think about a minimal example where this occurs. We would presumably need a sentence of the form `everything is not a Q", but then how could we have added ``something is a Q". maybe this could work for existentials that are conditionals??? can't get it to easily work out as a minimal counterexample...

% Proof idea for the Lemma: since $\Gamma_k \cup \{ \qt{\exists}{\script{x}} \metav{Q} \}$ is QND-consistent, we cannot derive a contradictory pair R and ~R from any sentences in it. Now when we add in the substitution instance, clearly this could not itself be the R, since by assumption the instantiating constant does not appear in the previous set, so we could not have ~Q[c/x] in the set already. 
% So the contradictory pair, if one were to arise, would have to be the result of derivations that both cite Q[c/x]. So we would have some finite Delta \cup Q[c/x] proves R and some possibly different finite Delta' \cup Q[c/x] proves ~R. But we could just enlarge one of the Deltas to have a single finite set Delta \cup Q[c/x] that proves both R and ~R. then by soundness, Delta \cup Q[c/x] would have to semantically entail a contradiction
% so at this point, it would suffice to prove that Delta \cup Q[c/x] is satisfiable , i.e. semantically consistent.
%That would show that there is some model that makes Delta \cup Q[c/x] true and then would also have to make R and ~R true, which is impossible. 

%(which I guess is what the book tries to do with their lemma 11.1.10, which presumably uses locality!), but we still don't seem to know that $\Gamma_k \cup \{ \qt{\exists}{\script{x}} \metav{Q} \}$ is satisfiable, which is needed to apply 11.1.10
% Perhaps at this point we can appeal to the soundness of our system

%other proof idea: go through our QND rules and argue that in no case could adding Q[c/x] lead to a contradictory sentence pair, assuming that the sentences w/ (Ex)Q doesn't lead to a contradictory sentence pair! 

% % Perhaps an even better proof idea! Assuming that \gamma \cup (Ex)Q is QND-consistent, this means that whenever we assume the given substitution instance Q[c/x] to start a sub proof for existential elimination, we must not be able to derive contradictory R and ~R. Since if we could, we could derive any Psi from \gamma \cup (Ex)Q, including a Psi that contradicts another sentence in \gamma \cup (Ex)Q. So that would amount to showing that \gamma \cup (Ex)Q is QND-inconsistent, which contradicts our assumption that it is not.
% I think this proof idea totally works and does not rely on the semantic 11.1.10 at all! (Which I'm still not really sure how we could get that to work in this case, since we have not shown that \gamma \cup (Ex)Q is quantificationally/semantically consistent. 

%wrote this out on back of section 11.1 and it totally works!!! then i realized the the book student soLN manual actually includes EXACTLY the same proof in problem 6 of section 11.4. Perhaps they simply lost track of what they show in problem 6. So they should really cite exercise 11.4.6 rather than the lemma 11.1.10, since they don't actually use that lemma here. It also seems like they, in this edition, forgot to note that problem 6 actually has two parts. They just list part b, leaving out part a, on page 583.

% %Note to Josh: Logic book p. 572 actually gives a direct proof of this claim that is probably better and more straightforward! although the proof below clarifies the defN of maximally QND-consistent! 

\item Assume for \textit{reductio} that $\Gamma^{\ast}$ weren't maximally QND-consistent, despite being QND-consistent

\item i.e. assume \textit{it is \textcolor{red}{not the case that}} for all other sentences, adding it to $\Gamma^{\ast}$ would result in a \textcolor{OGlyallpink}{QND-inconsistent} set

% % Relevant claim: for any additional sentence not already in $\Gamma^{\ast}$, adding Q to $\Gamma^{\ast}$ results in an QND-inconsistent set. So we negate this: there exists some Q such that when added to $\Gamma^{\ast}$, $\Gamma^{\ast}$  remains consistent. 

\item[] $\Rightarrow$ there exists a sentence $\metav{Q}$ that we could add to $\Gamma^{\ast}$ while preserving \alert{QND-consistency} (i.e. there is some sentence we neglected that could make $\Gamma^{\ast}$ a `bigger' QND-consistent set)
%relevant notion of `size' here is given by subset relation, rather than cardinality

\item Yet, $\metav{Q}$ would appear in our enumeration as some sentence $P_k$, `considered' at the $k$-th stage of our construction of $\Gamma^{\ast}$.

\item So if $\metav{Q}$ isn't in $\Gamma^{\ast}$, then this is because adding it `would have' made $\Gamma_k \subset \Gamma^{\ast}$ \textcolor{OGlyallpink}{QND-inconsistent}. \\ So $\{\metav{Q}\} \cup \Gamma^{\ast}$ must be QND-inconsistent (\textit{reductio}!)

% With my `primed-proof idea', where do numbers like 11 go? to 1'1'? perhaps alpha_11 would be better? , Although then I really am introducing infinitely many new constants. But I guess I'm doing the same thing here?
% I guess for my desired isomorphism, I need 11 to go to 11'. But I guess I can say this while still only introducing the 10 new symbols 0', 1', 2', 3'. Just put some wff clause on that primes come at most at the end of an index! This isn't really different in principle than saying that when we index constants, we can't write something like B_{1C0}, i.e. we disallow putting atomics in the index. so clearly, we have control over the syntax of the index for constants! 
% I could note that this is no different than introducing a new symbol alpha, that we can then index in the usual way, and use the index alpha itself as an index for constants.

\frametitle{Stage 3 (iii): Induction on QL$'$ (i.e. we still be clubbin')}
%\large

%so since doing induction on QL$'$, I guess I need to formally define recursive structure of its wff, which is just like QL only allowing more constants, namely by allowing more index symbols JUST for the constants. i guess I ought to make that clear! 

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Goal: construct a QL$'$-model $\mathfrak{M}^{\ast}$ that satisfies the $\exists$-C M-QND-C set $\Gamma^{\ast}$, i.e. that makes true everything in $\Gamma^{\ast}$ ($\mathfrak{M}^{\ast} \entails \Gamma^{\ast}$)

\item[] -- Suffices to construct $\mathfrak{M}^{\ast}$ s.t.  $\mathfrak{M}^{\ast} \entails \metav{P}$ iff $\metav{P} \in \Gamma^{\ast}$ 

\item[] Say that a sentence is ``\emph{clubbin'} " whenever it meets this property

\item We induct on the number of logical operators in a QL$'$ sentence: \\ i.e. the five connectives and two quantifiers (``conquans'')

%$\metav{I}(\metav{Q}) = True$ iff $\metav{Q} \in \Gamma^{\ast}$, $\forall  \metav{Q} \in$ QL. \\ Say that a sentence is ``\emph{clubbin'} " whenever it meets this property

%\item Define $\metav{I}$ such that $\metav{I}(B) = True$ iff atomic $B \in \Gamma^{\ast}$

\item \emph{Base case}: show that each QL$'$-sentence with \alert{zero} logical operators is clubbin' (i.e. the QL$'$-atomics be clubbin')

%atomic sentence is true on $\metav{I}$ iff it belongs to $\Gamma^{\ast}$ \\ (i.e. the atomics be clubbin')

\item (Strong) \emph{Induction hypothesis}: assume every QL$'$ sentence with $1$ to $k$-many operators is clubbin' 

\item Induction step: show that an arbitrary QL$'$ sentence with k+1-many operators is clubbin' 

%, i.e. a sentence is true on $\metav{I}$ iff it belongs to $\Gamma^{\ast}$

\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Base Case (true by construction)}
%\large

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Consider an arbitrary QL$'$-sentence $\metav{A}$ that has zero logical operators. (Two directions to show! ``iff")

\item Then $\metav{A}$ is either an atomic sentence letter $B$ or of the form $P\script{c}_1 \dots \script{c}_n$ for $n$-place predicate $P$. 

\item If a sentence letter, then by part 2 of our definition of $\mathfrak{M}^{\ast}$, $I^{\ast}(B) = true$ iff $B \in \Gamma^{\ast}$ (i.e. $\mathfrak{M}^{\ast} \entails B$ iff $B \in \Gamma^{\ast}$)

\item If $\metav{A}$ is of form $P\script{c}_1 \dots \script{c}_n$, then by definition $\mathfrak{M}^{\ast} \entails P\script{c}_1 \dots \script{c}_n$ iff $\langle \script{c}^D_1, \dots, \script{c}^D_n \rangle \in Ext(P)$. 

\item[] By part 4, $\langle \script{c}^D_1, \dots, \script{c}^D_n \rangle = \langle \script{c}_1, \dots, \script{c}_n \rangle \in Ext(P)$ iff $P\script{c}_1 \dots \script{c}_n \in \Gamma^{\ast}$

%\item Need to show \emph{TWO} directions!: 

%\item So both directions are met by construction 

\item We proceed to do induction using our QL$'$ induction schema: \\ an arbitrary sentence \metav{P} with k+1-many connectives has one of seven forms, coming from our seven operators

\item \alert{Induction hypothesis}: assume every QL sentence with $1$ to $k$-many operators is clubbin'

\item We have shown that the maximally-QND-consistent and existentially complete $\Gamma^{\ast}$ is satisfiable in QL$'$ 

\item It remains to show that QND-consistent $\Gamma$ is satisfiable \emph{in QL}

\item i.e. we need a QL-model $\mathfrak{M}$ s.t. $\mathfrak{M} \entails \Gamma$

\item \textbf{\textcolor{OGlyallpink}{Hopes and dreams}}: by construction $\Gamma \subset \Gamma^{\ast}$, so $\mathfrak{M}^{\ast} \entails \Gamma$ in QL$'$. \\ But how are we to get a QL-model for $\Gamma$ from this??????

\item \emph{Salvation}: note that the model $\mathfrak{M}^{\ast}$ we constructed is \textit{not only} a QL$'$ model for $\Gamma^{\ast}$  \textit{BUT ALSO} a QL-model for  $\Gamma$!

\item Since the language of QL is contained in QL$'$, $\mathfrak{M}^{\ast} := (D, I^{\ast})$ maps all symbols of QL to objects in $D$

\item If you like, you can define a QL-model $\mathfrak{M} := (D, I)$ s.t. $I$ is the restriction of $I^{\ast}$ to unprimed constants in QL. Then $\mathfrak{M} \entails \Gamma$. 

\item $\Box$ Q.E.D. MOST BLESSED STUDENTS!!! (i.e. \textit{quod erat demonstrandum})

%\item This is simply because it meets the definition of a QL-model: we have a domain (which includes constants from QL$'$ but now functioning as `objects') and a map I that maps all the stuff in QL to stuff in the domain. 

%\item namely let $I$ be the restriction of the $I^{\ast}$ in $\mathfrak{M}^{\ast}$, restricted to symbols in QL, all of which appear in QL$'$. so we're done

\iffalse 

\item Given a QL$'$-model $\mathfrak{M}'=(D, I')$ that satisfies $\Gamma'$, we construct a QL-model $\mathfrak{M}= (D, I)$ with the same domain as follows: 
\item[] for each subscripted QL-constant $\script{c}_i$, $I(\script{c}_i) :=I'(\script{c}'_i)$, and for the non-subscripted constants $I$ and $I'$ agree.
\item[] For each $k$-place predicate $P$, $I(P) := I'(P)$ 

\item Note that $I$ is well-defined because by construction the unprimed and primed constants stand in one-to-one correspondence, \\ and $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma'$ have exactly the same predicates %(they differ at most in the constants they use). 


% this amounts to simpling `relabeling' any primed-constant with an unprimed constant.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item In our condition (iii) for building up $\Gamma^{\ast}$, we manually enforced adding a substitution instance to our growing $\Gamma_{k+1}$ whenever we add an existential sentence. 

\item Some have wondered: shouldn't condition (ii) take care of this? Substitution instances are QL$'$ sentences, so they arise at some $k$ in our enumeration as well

\item Really the issue is the following: are there maximally QND-consistent sets that are NOT existentially-complete? If so, then our condition (iii) is not idle

\item So to show the necessity of our condition (iii) (or something like it), it suffices to construct a maximally QND-consistent set that has an existential sentence but no substitution instances for it.

\item Its substitution instances have the form $\enot F[c/x]$, e.g. $\enot Fc$. 

\item Notice that the `enemies' of these substitution instances always occur earlier in our enumeration, e.g. $Fc$ occurs before $\enot Fc$, $Fj'_{22}$ occurs before $\enot Fj'_{22}$ (the enemies always have one less symbol, so their index has two fewer digits)

\item So imagine that we dropped condition (iii) and built up $\Gamma^{\ast}$ using only conditions (i) and (ii). 

\item then $\Gamma^{\ast}$ would contain $\qt{\exists}{x}\enot Fx$ and every instance of an `enemy' substitution instance: $F\script{c}$ for all constants $\script{c}$

\item  $\Gamma^{\ast}$ would NOT contain a single substitution instance of $\qt{\exists}{x}\enot Fx$ because every time we hit a $\enot F\script{c}$ at its stage, $\Gamma_k$ would already contain its enemy $F\script{c}$, so that adding $\enot F\script{c}$ would result in a QND-inconsistent set.

\begin{itemize}[<+->]

\item Intuitively, you might think that a set containing $\qt{\exists}{x}\enot Fx$ and all these enemies $F\script{c}$ would be QND-inconsistent.

\item But it is not! Note that from existential elimination, we cannot start our subproof with a constant occuring in a premise, and these `enemies' would be premises. So there is no way to derive a contradiction
%we can derive a particular substitution instance of an existential 

\item Similarly, we can NOT go from an enemy to a contradictory universal $\qt{\forall}{x}Fx$ because the constant can't occur in a premise

\item Notice as well that the membership lemma would fail. We would have every instance of $F\script{c}$ but $\Gamma^{\ast}$ would NOT contain $\qt{\forall}{x}Fx$ because this sentence is QND-inconsistent with $\qt{\exists}{x}\enot Fx$ \\ (as an 8-line deduction shows)
